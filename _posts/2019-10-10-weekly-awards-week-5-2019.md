Every fantasy podcast I’ve been listening to has been losing their minds at some of the scores players have put up this week. Well we had some season records this week too, with out highest and lowest scores of the season put up in week 5. You either had them or you didn’t, either relaxing whilst refreshing the scores or cringing with your hands covering your eyes.

Is it me or has trading dried up a little this season? It feels like people have moulded their teams since the start-up draft and now we have higher values for our own players than what people are willing to pay for and I say this as I’ve put out very few offers myself. Or is it the looming legendary 2020 draft that people are holding onto picks a little tighter?

Just wanted to mention the opening game at the Spurs ground on Sunday. The stadium is fantastic, RedZone on the concourse, beer vendors walking around to keep queue times down, quick security into it as well. Downsides are the narrow seats, the higher prices than at Spurs games and the fact that the nearest tube stations are not that close and are not built to cope with the amount of people going to and from the game (Seven Sisters was a 20 minute walk, not the 30 that it says). Anybody going next week, head towards gates 10-12 afterwards to see the players leaving and realise you have no idea what most NFL players look like. 

### The Buzzsaw - Chippenham Packers

In week 4, the Hereford Chargers put up the worst score of the week, so Jason had a meeting with his players to refocus and it resulted in a crazy 100+ increase in their score from 60.9 to 169.74! 
But that was still not enough to take the buzzsaw award, the Packers scored the highest total of the season so far, 192.22, which is 20 points more than the Wombats score in week 1. Aaron Jones and Michael Thomas alone would have been enough to beat 3 other teams this week. Poor Michael put up is highest score of the season as well, but no one was beating the Packers, no one!

### Highest Point Scorer - Hereford Chargers (wut)

4 players scored over 40 points and if you had one of them, you weekend was a lot more relaxing that usual! Aaron Jones got the infamous 4 TDs in one game and it was a pleasure to see them scored against the Cowboys but that was 1 point short of Will Fuller who scored 3 TDs and over 200 yards receiving. Fuller and Jones were always capable of this they just needed the chance. The Chargers had Fuller and also Cooper and Chark in their line up which is 3 of the top 7!!!

### Unluckiest Loser - Nottingham Bandits

Once again, the fourth highest score is not enough to register a win as the Bandits lose the second highest scoring Chargers. The Bandits are one of only 3 teams to score over 100 points in each week so far which proves even if you have a great team, you need a little bit of luck along the way because as it stands they are not the division leaders are not guaranteed a playoff spot.

Honourable mention to the Fireflies who also posted a top half score and would have beaten my Eagles or Dan’s Seahawks, a 1-4 record is a little harsh

### Closest Matchup - Oxford Seahawks

No close ones this week. The absurdly high scoring from certain players meant that most victories were assured, you either had one or two of these players and you won, or you didn’t and you lost. The closest match up this week was between the Seahawks and the frankly nosediving Otters. There have been 60 totals posted so far this season and 4 out of 5 of the Otters results are 50 or lower. What has happened to the former Champ?

The Seahawks got a lucky win with the 9th highest score of the week but it didn’t feel lucky due to the margin and I’m pretty sure Dan doesn’t care as it keeps him within a game at the top of the South.

### Most Impactful Injury - Wigan Wombats

Were there any fantasy relevant injuries this week? I mean the Mason Rudolph concussion was scary, especially by the way JuJu reacted, but the Fireflies were never starting him anyway.

Sammy Watkins was probably the only one that could be considered as he was in the Wombats line up and the WR depth behind him is slim pickings at best.

### Worst Decision - Coventry Eagles

As I look through the line-ups, I don’t really see any mistakes as all the big hitters were started this week, Fuller, Jones, CMC, Watson, MT. Only 3 players in the top 20 players of the week didn’t start for their teams (Ryan, Breida, Teddy) and I had 2 of the them so I think I’ll give this one to myself

Last week was the week of big scores, this week was quite the opposite. Only half the teams managed to break the 100-point barrier with 4 teams getting 70 points or less, and I think this was due to the fact that many big name players failed to score big. Half of the top 12 scorers of the week were not on starting line-ups, which shows that, now byes and injuries are taking an effect, it’s not set and forget if you want to get the win.

Week 4 was the great equaliser of the league with 4 teams atop with 3-1, 4 teams in the middle with 2-2 and 4 teams at the bottom with 1-3. Nobody is undefeated and nobody is winless which I think is a great sign that the league isn’t lopsided either way.

### The Buzzsaw - Derby Otters

I didn’t see it coming! I’m minding my own business, not a care in the world as I take on a winless team that hasn’t scored above 80 points so far this season, quietly putting up a decent score, not worried that I missed out on the Thursday Night points and Shep puts a bullet in the back of my head. 

In a week of relatively low scoring, the Otters put up a nice score of 145 points (double his normal weekly output this season) but it could have been even higher, with Winston and Gallman left on the bench. Championships have been won on the back of Todd Gurley and even though he rushed just 5 times, he scored 22 points and Shep will not care how he gets those points. If Connor and Gurley can be the backs they were meant to be and AJ Brown becomes the WR that Corey Davis was meant to be, the Otters might not be at the bottom of the pile for long.

### Highest Point Scorer - Nottingham Bandits

Yep, I want Nick Chubb
Nick Chubb is a guy that can get some points for me
Hangin' out the flex spot side
Of the Bandits ride
Hope he trades him over to me

That 88 yard TD run was a thing of beauty, he seemed to get faster the further he got down the field and getting 3TDs to the tune of 37.8 fantasy points, the Browns need to use the man more often!

Second highest scorer was also on the Bandits (Chris Godwin, 35.2 points) which meant that 57% of Josh’s points came from just 2 players!!!

### Unluckiest Loser - Coventry Eagles

I got the 4th highest score this week. Another team won with less that 70 points. Everyone else who topped 100 points got a win.

These are the reasons why I finally get to present myself with an award as I always feel the need to justify it a little more. Did I already mention that Shep’s previous scores were 79, 67 and 74?

### Closest Matchup - Gateshead Spartans

Gateshead Spartans 69.6 – 69.14 Irish Flyers

That is a disgusting score line and the Spartans steal a win but just 0.46 points. 

Imagine going to bed on Monday night thinking you just need Andy Dalton to get 4.2 points and you’ll get an ugly win and move on in the hope that Barkley is back sooner rather than later. 3.64 is all he got and it exposed the other mistakes that Dermy made such as starting Melvin Gordon (who goose-egged). And there is nothing worse than the Thursday night goose-egg that Agholor put up.

### Most Impactful Injury - Coventry Eagles

Add Josh Allen and Mitch Trubisky the list of week one quarterbacks that won’t be playing in week five. Scott would start Watson and Gardner before Mitch and Dan will always start Wilson over Allen so they are both not too bad for their teams.

The most painful looking one was to TJ Hockenson but Olly has Jack Doyle, who thankfully has a head on his shoulders despite Burfict’s best efforts, and the emerging Dawson Knox.

Losing Marlon Mack might be frustrating for Chris with Damien Williams already out but McCaffrey can carry that whole position and White, Freeman or Thompson can fill in for a while.

Davante Adams has the dreaded turf toe and add that to Antonio Brown losing his goddamn mind and TY Hilton being out, my WR position has gone from deep to a puddle.

I’m feeling generous to myself so I’ll take another one.

### Worst Decision - Irish Flyers

There were some doozies this week!!!

As I’ve already said, Dermy threw Melvin Gordon straight into his line up even though Ekeler had been doing well enough in his absence to suggest that he would continue to get the workload until Gordon in shape and out of the doghouse. Next week would have been the better bet, and playing Burkhead or Hogan instead would have stolen the win even though they only scored 1.1 and 1.2 points respectively.

Matt Breida on a bye meant that I had to replace him and in my mind it was between Howard and Cohen. My heart said play Howard, as Eagles podcasts had been saying all week that the Packers allowed run yards, but my brain said that the Eagles like to throw, so I chose Cohen who scored 8.8 points whilst Howard got 31. Not a game decider but a lot of points left on the bench.

Chris started Brady, who was playing a very tough Bills defense, over Aaron Rodgers who was playing an Eagles defense that has neither good nor healthy cornerbacks. Metcalf over Landry was also an interesting one but I can see the boom or bust choice in that decision.

Although my decision cost the most points, Dermy’s decision cost him a win.
