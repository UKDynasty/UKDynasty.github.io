Every fantasy podcast I’ve been listening to has been losing their minds at some of the scores players have put up this week. Well we had some season records this week too, with out highest and lowest scores of the season put up in week 5. You either had them or you didn’t, either relaxing whilst refreshing the scores or cringing with your hands covering your eyes.

Is it me or has trading dried up a little this season? It feels like people have moulded their teams since the start-up draft and now we have higher values for our own players than what people are willing to pay for and I say this as I’ve put out very few offers myself. Or is it the looming legendary 2020 draft that people are holding onto picks a little tighter?

Just wanted to mention the opening game at the Spurs ground on Sunday. The stadium is fantastic, RedZone on the concourse, beer vendors walking around to keep queue times down, quick security into it as well. Downsides are the narrow seats, the higher prices than at Spurs games and the fact that the nearest tube stations are not that close and are not built to cope with the amount of people going to and from the game (Seven Sisters was a 20 minute walk, not the 30 that it says). Anybody going next week, head towards gates 10-12 afterwards to see the players leaving and realise you have no idea what most NFL players look like. 

### The Buzzsaw - Chippenham Packers

In week 4, the Hereford Chargers put up the worst score of the week, so Jason had a meeting with his players to refocus and it resulted in a crazy 100+ increase in their score from 60.9 to 169.74! 
But that was still not enough to take the buzzsaw award, the Packers scored the highest total of the season so far, 192.22, which is 20 points more than the Wombats score in week 1. Aaron Jones and Michael Thomas alone would have been enough to beat 3 other teams this week. Poor Michael put up is highest score of the season as well, but no one was beating the Packers, no one!

### Highest Point Scorer - Hereford Chargers (wut)

4 players scored over 40 points and if you had one of them, you weekend was a lot more relaxing that usual! Aaron Jones got the infamous 4 TDs in one game and it was a pleasure to see them scored against the Cowboys but that was 1 point short of Will Fuller who scored 3 TDs and over 200 yards receiving. Fuller and Jones were always capable of this they just needed the chance. The Chargers had Fuller and also Cooper and Chark in their line up which is 3 of the top 7!!!

### Unluckiest Loser - Nottingham Bandits

Once again, the fourth highest score is not enough to register a win as the Bandits lose the second highest scoring Chargers. The Bandits are one of only 3 teams to score over 100 points in each week so far which proves even if you have a great team, you need a little bit of luck along the way because as it stands they are not the division leaders are not guaranteed a playoff spot.

Honourable mention to the Fireflies who also posted a top half score and would have beaten my Eagles or Dan’s Seahawks, a 1-4 record is a little harsh

### Closest Matchup - Oxford Seahawks

No close ones this week. The absurdly high scoring from certain players meant that most victories were assured, you either had one or two of these players and you won, or you didn’t and you lost. The closest match up this week was between the Seahawks and the frankly nosediving Otters. There have been 60 totals posted so far this season and 4 out of 5 of the Otters results are 50 or lower. What has happened to the former Champ?

The Seahawks got a lucky win with the 9th highest score of the week but it didn’t feel lucky due to the margin and I’m pretty sure Dan doesn’t care as it keeps him within a game at the top of the South.

### Most Impactful Injury - Wigan Wombats

Were there any fantasy relevant injuries this week? I mean the Mason Rudolph concussion was scary, especially by the way JuJu reacted, but the Fireflies were never starting him anyway.

Sammy Watkins was probably the only one that could be considered as he was in the Wombats line up and the WR depth behind him is slim pickings at best.

### Worst Decision - Coventry Eagles

As I look through the line-ups, I don’t really see any mistakes as all the big hitters were started this week, Fuller, Jones, CMC, Watson, MT. Only 3 players in the top 20 players of the week didn’t start for their teams (Ryan, Breida, Teddy) and I had 2 of the them so I think I’ll give this one to myself
