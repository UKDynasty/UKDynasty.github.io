Said it once, I’ll say it again, I LOVE REDZONE!!! Watching all those comebacks was brilliant and none of them were involving my team but I was rooting hard for the Jets to beat the Browns. I know it is probably just a minority that are making the signs that support Watson or make light of his crimes (***Ed:** My lawyer has asked me to mention that Watson has not been convicted of any crimes, but he's a fucking weirdo. That's what the lawyer said. Weird, huh?*), but the other fans shouldn’t be letting it happen.

Scandal as the league trophy was shown little respect either by the inaugural champ or the current one, either way it was unacceptable to see it put at such risk on Sunday.

All intra-divisional match ups this week meant that the Midlands finally has some wins in the division but the emerging team in the early weeks are the Wombats. Two wins out of two and the highest points for so far has them looking like a strong contender for the number 1 seed and that all important bye week.

The Cobras, Eagles and the Sandslashers are the only teams without a win so far and according to MFL, my Eagles have 55% chance of getting that first win this week against the Fireflies whilst the Sandslashers have a 30% chance and the Cobras only a 7% chance.

### The Buzzsaw

If you wanna win, you go for the Champ!

The Wombats showed no respect for the reigning league and buzzsaw champions and topped the scoring this week with an impressive 157.46 points, even with two players not even scoring above 2 points (Jeudy and Penny). You knew that one of the trio of Tua/Hill/Waddle had to be in this line up, and Tyreek was, but it could have been better as Jon had Tua on his bench! Aaron Jones enjoyed playing against the Bears to put up 30 points as well with Herbert and Andrews topping 20 points. The scary thing is that this didn’t seem a fluke, just a hell of a starting line up.

### Highest Point Scorer

No surprises with the top two players being the quarterbacks of the Dolphins and Ravens, but I was surprised that Tua was second to Lamar. Throwing for 469 yards and 6 TDs scored 38.86 points, but throwing for 318 yards and 3 TDs followed up by 119 yards and a rush TD made Lamar get 42.62 points. Last week’s top score of 34.9 would have only been good for 5th place this week (stat corrections meant that Mahomes actually tied with the score for JJ, but I’m not changing last week now, sorry Josh).

The Pythons continue their strong “scoring” start to the season with this week’s number 1 and number 6 scoring players, and have back to back HPS wins.

### Unluckiest Loser

I thought I could steal it with Hurts’ performance on Monday night and his 33 points were the standout score on my starting line-up but my 5th place score wasn’t enough to beat Shep’s 4th place score. Diggs cancelled Hurts out and a big fat zero from Albert O did the most damage.

Both the Seahawks and the Leopards won with lower scores, the Leopards even with the 9th highest score get a win in the column which keeps them joint top of the North, whereas I don’t win my opening two games for the first time I believe.

### Worst Decision

This could be one of those weeks for me…

Julio going out late really messed up my starting line up (feels bad saying that) as I thought he could have a decent game with Godwin out but who to put in? Sammy Watkins might have a game because Rodgers would return to normal now week 1 was out of the way? Noah Brown was my waiver pick up and Cooper Rush should have chemistry with him, right? Or Albert O as Wilson’s TE in a revenge game vs a bad Texans team? Any decision apart from the one I made, Albert O, and I get my first win of the season.

I was seriously considering the Cobras having Wan’Dale Robinson as I’m pretty sure he was ruled out before the weekend started but then I looked at the other options on the bench and yeesh! I can’t even blame Jason for it because even with three players putting up zeros and one getting 0.6 points, his efficiency rating was 92%, the second highest in the league!

Shoutout to the Commish for still starting Darnell Mooney who took a 3 target 1 reception 8-yard week and made it worse with a 2 target 1 reception -4 yard week! (***Ed:** Can I delete parts of the awards that I don't like?*)

### Closest Matchup

And I get the hat-trick!!!

This week was very much a matchup that was a blow out or was a nail biter. Fireflies and Pythons more than doubled their opponents and the Wombats had a healthy margin of 55 points, but the Leopards snuck their win by just 6.5 points, the Seahawks by just 2.4 points and the Otters got theirs by just 1.02 points against my Eagles. I’m starting 3 Washington players for Christ’s sake! Fecking Alvin Kamara, I need those 6 TD games from you, not rib injuries!

### Most Impactful Injury

The Sandslashers may be in a similar situation as the 49ers, older QB with younger one (or two) behind ready to take over soon, but luckily for them, the Trey Lance injury doesn’t hurt as much as Rodgers is a great starter and Wilson should be back in time for any bye week issues.

Mike Evans’ suspension might be an issue for the Leopards but Pollard, Palmer and maybe a returning Keenan Allen should fill that void for a week. What is it with Evans and Lattimore?! Reminds me of the Andre Johnson vs Cortland Finnegan feud but I thought it was harsh on Lattimore to get ejected for pretty much just annoying Brady.

James Conner for the Otters might miss some time with a knee injury and the Otters backfield is already looking a little thin - surprisingly still having Todd Gurley in it - but then again if Ameer Abdullah is still scoring points, then you never know! 

I think the only real major injury was to Lance so I’ll give this one to Scott.
