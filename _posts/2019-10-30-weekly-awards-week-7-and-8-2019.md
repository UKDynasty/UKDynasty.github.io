Apologies for the lack of awards last week, real life has been getting in the way, on the road most of last week in the UK and this week in the USA. Next week is a lot calmer, so I should have the awards out at a decent time.

We are approaching Week 9 and it is time to start paying attention to the standings, as there are only 5 games left before the playoffs. The Midlands and the South have teams at the top with a decent lead, but the North is all up for grabs with all 4 teams within two wins of each other. Now is the time to start looking at rosters to see where the strengths and weaknesses are and maybe we start seeing more trades. 

### The Buzzsaw - Chippenham Packers, twice

Week 7

A fairly low scoring week is exemplified in a low buzzsaw score of 121.06, but it is a 3rd award for the Packers and they take a lead in the South. Only 3 teams managed to get over 100 points and there were winning scores below 90

Week 8

The Packers have the bit between their teeth and win a second buzzsaw in a row, but this time with a more appropriate score of 163.38 points, fuelled by five of the team scoring over 20 points. In the true spirit of the buzzsaw, the matchup with the Chargers was a bloodbath! The winning margin (105) was larger than the total scores of 5 teams this week!!!

### Highest Point Scorer - Gateshead Spartans & Chippenham Packers

Week 7

Aaron Rodgers went crazy for the Green Bay Packers and scored the weeks only over 40 score but it didn't help the Spartans who could have used the 43.76 points. At least this award may sooth the blow. In a stroke of genius the Otters started Marvin Jones who scored the second highest with 38.3 points and Chase Edmunds rode the bench with 34 points.

Week 8

I was watching the SNF football game and Chris Collinsworth was going crazy every time the Packers threw the ball to Aaron Jones. They used the same play over and over again and the Chiefs wouldn’t adjust to it and Jones had the week's highest score of 38.1, helping the Packers to their buzzsaw. Mike Evans for the Flyers got close with 37.3 points but maybe next week it might be Chris Godwin getting those points.

### Unluckiest Loser - Oxford Seahawks & Nottingham Bandits 

Week 7

Poor Seahawks score the 4th highest score of the week, enough to beat North powerhouse Bandits, current champion Eagles and local rival Pythons but they were playing against the third highest scoring Wombats this week. It stalls the charge to the top of the South when the Packers are getting into a groove.

Week 8

The Bandits must have been licking their chops at the sight of the Sandslashers matchup after they put up a measly 62 points in week 7. A nice score of 113.92, almost double that week 7 total, should have been enough for a win but instead the Sandslashers wake up and score 114.86. The Bandits score was only the 5th highest though!

### Closest Matchup - Coventry Eagles & Andover Sandslashers

Week 7

Most matchups were relatively smooth and comfortable, over 20 points wins, apart from one match up, Eagles vs Chargers. I put up a weak 84.66 points but the Chargers just couldn’t quite score enough to steal a surprise win - but it was close at 6.7 points. Byes, injuries and schedules make this game tense!

Week 8

This week, it was either close or it really wasn’t! Margins of 106, 40 and 32 were simple matchups but three others were at 11, 4 and 0.94. The Sandslashers put on a show and stole the win against the Bandits by a 5 yard catch.

### Most Impactful Injury - Oxford Seahawks & Gateshead Spartans

Week 7

Purely based on how much Dan loves him, it has to be Kerryon Johnson going on IR. Simple!

Week 8

How many concussions is Brandin Cooks going to suffer before he is forced to retire? It’s not even “mild” ones, he is usually knocked out cold and his injury really limits the WR options for the Spartans, who with the Theilen questionability, are left with pretty much just Edelman and Metcalf.

### Worst Decision - Oxford Seahawks & Flitwick Fireflies

Week 7

It has to be considered one of the worst moves of the week when the week’s highest scorer is left on the bench, so the Spartans are in the mix. If the Chargers start Jonnu Smith instead of old man Delaine Walker they steal the win. The Seahawks make what I would consider the worst decision by starting Henderson over Latavius Murray. Henderson hasn’t shown much this season so far and Murray is stepping into the Kamara role with no competition.

Week 8

Sorry Mike, but this section is all for you!

Kyler Murray is facing a top 5 defense in the Saints whilst Daniel Jones is facing the bottom third Lions. Starting Jones instead of Murray and that is a week 8 win.

Rashard Higgins hasn’t really played this season but when straight into the Fireflies lineup over Mark Walton and Preston Williams who have had decent floors so far this season. Starting either of them instead of Higgins and that is a week 8 win.
