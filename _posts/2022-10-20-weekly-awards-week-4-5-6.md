What’s better than the week’s awards? A DOUBLE WEEK!
What’s better than a double week?? A TRIPLE WEEK!

In all seriousness, sorry for the delay in these guys, work and family hit like waves sometimes!

No league thoughts this time, I’ll save that for next week when I can do just a single week focus so I’ll just get some NFL points off my chest

- Eagles are unbeaten but I’d still put my mortgage payments on the Bills or Chiefs to win it all
- Cowboys cry about losing with a backup QB? Please, we won it all with our backup QB!!
- Cardinals are frauds. Feel like the Man Utd of the NFL, relying on their star power rather than leadership and a good philosophy.
- Dolphins are cursed. 20 years of Brady, now probably 20 years of Allen and they can’t keep a QB on the field for more than 30 minutes
- Jags are better than their record, Chargers are worse
- Steelers fans, you better pray every night to give thanks for Mike Tomlin. That team would be as bad as the Texans if it wasn’t for him.
- I have a certain schadenfreude for seeing Aaron Rodgers struggle. Feel a little bad for Russell Wilson though as he seems to be a total nerd who is trying to be cool and it’s falling apart.

### The Buzzsaw

#### Week 4

The Fireflies are flying, and boy did they need to be! 154.98 points are the third highest of the season so far and they were facing the fourth highest total of the season so far. The Pythons did their best but they ran into the buzzsaw of a trio of running backs that all scored more than 20 points. Josh Jacobs had what is probably a career game getting 32 points, the rookie sleeper Dameon Pierce hit a high of 22.9 points and CEH hype is real (spoilers, it might not be) with another 21.9 points with both air and ground scores. Even the slowing down of Waddle was handled!

#### Week 5

Now this was a buzzsaw week! The Bandits scored the highest score of the season with a whopping 180.48 points and that was with an efficiency of 91.3%! Swap CeeDee Lamb for Tyler Lockett and they would have been knocking on the door of 200 points. Mahomes and Kelce lead the way with scores over 30 points and were supported by Chubb, Adams, Mostert and Wilson scoring 18 or more points. Scary!

#### Week 6

Is it really a buzzsaw with a score of 116.64? That score would have been ranked in the following positions in previous weeks: 6th, 4th, 5th, 6th and 5th and is the 22nd highest score of the season so far but I don’t think the Sandslashers will care at all as the average fantasy score was down 10 points in week 6. Brandon Aiyuk was the only player to break 20 points that started and Mike Gesicki was the only other one that did and he was on the bench.

That win keeps them in touch with the South leading Pythons and ready for the big match up with the Spartans.

### Highest Point Scorer

#### Week 4

Three players in the top five, all with over 30 points for the Pythons with TJ Hockenson leading the way with 35.9 points which is almost double his total in the previous 3 weeks! Not surprising in some ways as the Seahawks are terrible against Tight Ends and 180 yards/2TDs is the output that was expected of a player of his quality. Of course the second highest player is the man throwing him the ball, Jared Goff, but the Pythons didn’t have that magical pairing starting (understandably).

#### Week 5

Josh Allen’s first half alone against the Steelers would probably have been enough for a top 5 finish in the week but the absolute destruction with 424 yards/4TDs feels like meat left on the bone!!! The Seahawks other 8 players only just outscored him in a surprising bad week, but this season Allen hasn’t scored less than 23 points in each week. The scourge of Taysom Hill continued the Seahawks failure against “Tight Ends” and he had the second highest score with 34.08 points and I don’t know why, but seeing him run the ball annoys the life out of me!!!

#### Week 6

Quarterback and their main target seem to be great matches and this week it was the turn of the Bengals. Joe Burrow led the week with 32.5 points and Chase was second with 28.7 points. I feel the need to apologise to Jason again here as I see CCB next to his name and I assume that means the Beavers but can’t see him anywhere on their roster and only realised it meant Cobras when I thought MFL had messed up and I Ctrl+F for him and found him!

Look at the top 5 scorers so far this season and they are all QBs (Allen, Jackson, Hurts, Mahomes, Burrow) which I feel is a change from the past and in fact kind of tallys with something I heard on a podcast this week, that scoring is at it’s lowest since 2007.

### Unluckiest Loser

#### Week 4

The fourth highest total of the season up to that point and still losing, that is the kind of thing that ruins a Monday and Tuesday morning! I feel like this award was made for this moment and if it had a real trophy, I’d retire it to Olly like the Jules Rimet and commission another one. 151 points and still losing by almost 4 points… Amon-Ra was ruled out earlier in the week but remained in the Pythons line up when swapping him for Allgeier or Burkhead or Hilliard could have won it. Or if Claypool hadn’t been held to a zero point game!!! Painful.

#### Week 5

Nothing but comfortable wins this week with almost all of the top 6 scoring teams getting a win. I say almost as the Leopards have the 6th overall score (by just 0.25 points) and they came up against the season high scoring Bandits. Are you an unluck loser if you lose by 78 points??? Counts for this award though

#### Week 6

It feels like this is a bit of a cursed season for the Seahawks as they have the 7th highest scoring team so far this season but face on average 10 more points per week than any other team, 30 points per week less than the 6-0 Wombats! Their fifth highest score of the week came up against the second highest score of the said Wombats who are also scoring around 30 points more per week.

### Worst Decision

#### Week 4

Pretty easy one, Amon-Ra St Brown was ruled out a couple of days before the game for Detroit but Olly kept him in the line-up and it cost him the win. Granted, there weren’t many wide receiver options with maybe Amon-Ra’s brother Equanimeous as an option but he didn’t do much better. Rex Burkhead was probably the right play as he had a solid floor.

#### Week 5

Will the Wombats ever trust Geno over Herbert? I wouldn’t but maybe…

Sandslashers going Hines over his own Jag’s Etienne?

That’s the extent of the decisions I have to work with here…. Anyone else see anything else, let me know otherwise the Sandslashers take it.

#### Week 6

Curtis Samuel on TNF, what was I thinking!!! Teams aren’t scoring points on Thursdays, so why would Wentz and Samuel change that? Ben Skowronek seems to be the player that Allen Robinson was meant to be and was the better play.

Gallup hasn’t looked quite right since his return and he was going up against maybe the best CB duo in Slay and Bradberry. Play Mooney instead and this would have been close to an upset.

Can’t blame the Bandits for starting Mostert and Wilson over Murray but that was a game losing error.

This one is mine.

### Closest Matchup

#### Week 4

This matchup has seen a lot of attention so far and it continues as it was the closet matchup by far. How often is a Buzzsaw winner also the winner of the closest matchup? Well, the Fireflies win this by just 3.92 points which is crazy when you compare that to the 74-point difference between the Cobras and the Wombats.

#### Week 5

As I said in the previous section, this was not a week of blowouts with the average win being just shy of 50 points. The Wombats win over the Spartans was the closest of the bunch, just a 26.7 point gap (or a Breece Hall tally for the week). Other margins were 39.8 points, 77.9 points, 45.2 points, 55.5 points and 49.1 points, a very have or have not week.

#### Week 6

This is more like it! 1.8 points was all that separated the Cobras getting a celebrated win over the Pythons. If only Everett had caught just one of Ekeler’s targets, it would have been reversed on Monday night… But the Pythons get the win and have a game advantage in the South.

Three other match ups were settled by less than 10 points, lots of possibly season-changing results

### Most Impactful Injury

#### Week 4

Javonte Williams, you hate to see it. Promising running back, taking control, supplanting a veteran and then they suffer a season ending injury. The Wombats know how that can go as they are seeing the aftermath with Cam Akers. The Wombats are without Dalvin Cook in week 7 so it is only Chase Edmonds and Jamaal Williams left (100% efficiency rating there)

Johnathan Taylor’s injury isn’t as serious but it puts pressure on the Seahawks. They however are feeling the benefit of the Akers situation though and Henderson seems to be the lead back for the Rams and Khalil Herbert is filling in for David Montgomery.

Wombats take this week.

#### Week 5

The Otters have sizable stable of running backs but James Conner was one of the leaders of the club house and he didn’t finish the Eagles game. Eno Benjamin might be looking to supplant him for the Cardinals but the Otters don’t mind as they have him as well.

Otters also technically have 4 starting QBs but Baker is injured and likely benched. Fields is very, very raw as is Pickett and Jameis might be benched for Dalton.

Damien Harris is out for the Fireflies but their backfield is quite frankly a little scary and they have the other Pats back to own, Stevenson.

The Wombats lose Penny but Barkley and Jones are able to carry the load (I’m hanging big onions there!).

Otters get this one.

#### Week 6

Pickett was not only raw, but he was knocked out of the Buccaneers game and Trubisky kept the ship afloat, maybe earning another second chance.

Fireflies lose Hollywood Brown who was their top scoring WR and that hurts as he was probably about to receive less attention from defenders with the return of Hopkins.

Fireflies “win” this week.
