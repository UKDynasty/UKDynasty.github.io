What a weird week: scores were down, Fireflies win, Flyers lose…

Michael, if you want us to vote on giving you an extra 1st round pick to compensate for the damage Hamza (and all of us who took advantage) caused, you need to stop winning, as you currently have the joint-2nd longest active winning streak!

We are past halfway through the fantasy season, with just 6 games left, and the difference between the North and South is evident. My Eagles can clinch a playoff spot with just two more wins whereas Dermy’s Flyers need another four. Week 8 has top of the table clashes in the South with my Eagles vs Scott’s Sandslashers and in the North with Dermy’s Flyers vs Josh’s Bandits. Then there is the battle of the Chris’s which has massive playoff implications. 

The Eagles v Sandslashers game is mirrored with the Eagles vs Jags game at Wembley this weekend, and even if Ryan wasn’t on a bye, I’d be starting Wentz to give myself even more reason cheer from the stands. Although after the terrible defeats both our teams suffered this week, I’d celebrate winning 2-0 on a safety in overtime! 

I’ll be at the Green Man in my white Wentz jersey if anyone wants face to face trade negotiations or my opinion on Donovan McNabb’s legacy on the Eagles history.

**Special note**: New awards are welcome but I won’t add them until next season. Biggest Disappointment will be added.

### Worst Line-up Decision  

Week 7 sounds like Week 6, as I again question Scott’s decision to start Watson over Trubisky and it’s even worse as he was betting against his own team! No faith that the Jags D would rebound against a quarterback with lung issues when Trubisky has averaged 34 points in his last 3 games. But with Jags losing and benching Bortles before we see him next week, Scott has been punished enough.

Onto the battle of Oxford where Olly threw away the chance for bragging rights until the last game of the regular season (a battle for 1.01 maybe?). Jeff Heuermann hasn’t scored all season so is limited to yards for points and his big fat zero on Thursday night must have been difficult to look at all weekend when Ben Watson was the other option. Also, choosing Ratley over Hogan proved costly so the combination of those 2 game deciding decisions means Olly takes the trophy.

### Most Impactful Injury 

The 2 division leaders got hit with double running back problems. My Eagles suffered injuries to Michel and Powell which trims my already thin RB corp, but Dermy’s Flyers suffered the surprise loss of Melvin Gordon and the in-game loss of LeSean McCoy. Gordon is expected back next week, and Carson will be coming off his bye week, but the loss of Lynch to IR in the week tips this in Dermy’s favour.

### Closest Matchup 

3 very close games this week, all of them settled by fewer than 10 points. My Eagles squeaked by Jason’s Chargers, overturning a 20 point deficit on Monday night to win by just 8.3. Michael’s Fireflies beat the defending champ Otters by 7.2 points even though 2 of his players scored ZERO points (for shame Chris, for shame!).

But the closest match was the bitter Oxford rivalry with Dan sneaking it by 3.1 points thanks to Matt Breida getting negative points and questionable roster decisions by Olly who I can only assume was distracted at Wembley by wandering into group shots at the Green Man.

### Unluckiest Loser 

This one has to really hurt for Mr Moffatt, scoring the 3rd highest total of the week and still losing, when teams like the Eagles (7th) and Packers (9th) manage a win. Even if he had faced Dermy, he still would have won and been in the playoff picture, but instead it was Josh who put a win between him and his Northern rivals. If only he had played the other starting RB at Wembley this week…

### The Buzzsaw

Talk about kicking a man when he is down, Chris not only is the first person to beat Dermy’s Flyers this year, he did it by winning The Buzzsaw with the biggest winning margin of the week! It could have been even bigger as Mack and Amendola would have added another 30+ points to the score but they were left on the bench. A statement win for the former Champion Spartans? Maybe, as this is the second Buzzsaw and he hasn’t scored below 100 points since week 1. But as it stands right now, they miss the playoffs.

### Highest Individual Player Score

The curse continues to strike!!!!

Kareem Hunt’s 3 TD game racked up 34.6 points for the Wombats but like the last couple of weeks, it seems to drain points from the rest of the roster. Hunt outscored 5 other members of the Wombat’s starting line-up, with Evan Engram a stand-out disappointment on the season so far, and combined with the bad start/sit decisions, it sends the Wombats to a 3-4 record and a game behind the playoff race in the North.
