I was trying to wait for ESPN to re-open following its incessant annual maintenance before kicking off the Owners' Meeting, but apparently they struggle to get a bit of website maintenance done within a few days, despite being 80% owned by a $153bn company.

So, here we are. We've got 4 possible rule changes to vote on this year - let me know ASAP if you have anything else you'd like to be taken into consideration.

- Flyers: Allow zero dollar bids for waiver bids (current rule: $1 minimum)
- Flyers: Add an extra IR spot (current rule: 3 IR spots during the season)
- Wombats: Re-align the divisions and add an extra 'Midlands' division. This is a complex idea requiring its own page of explanation: [click here for details](/misc/division-shakeup-concept)
- Flyers: Replace the 3rd WR spot in starting lineups with a 3rd Flex spot (current rule: start 3 WRs, 2 Flex) **NOTE**: this change would take effect from the 2020 season onwards
- Pythons: Remove divisions entirely, just have one division of 12 (current rule: 2 divisions of 6)
- Seahawks: Move league permanently to MyFantasyLeague, with owners splitting $69.95 cost annually (Â£4.51 each, on current rates)

If you have any questions about any of the suggestions, please discuss in the league chat.

To submit your votes, please copy/paste the following, remove FOR or AGAINST and leave your preference for each suggestion, and send to your dutiful commissioner on GroupMe.
