Playoffs are upon us. With spots still to play for in Week 13, I must tip my hat to the divisional realignment for keeping things interesting all the way through to the end. 

North division winners: Gateshead Spartans (10-3, 1574.08 PF)  
Midlands division winners: Coventry Eagles (8-5, 1361.26 PF)  
South division winners: Chippenham Packers (10-3, 1616.60 PF)

That sorts out our top 3 seeds, with the Packers and Spartans getting the byes.

1. Chippenham Packers  
2. Gateshead Spartans  
3. Coventry Eagles

4th and 5th seeds go to the next two best records:

4. Oxford Pythons (7-6, 1345.08 PF)  
5. Irish Flyers (7-6, 1277.98 PF)

6th seed goes to the remaining highest points scorer over the season:

6. Nottingham Bandits (6-7, 1487.38 PF)

Thus, we have our Wildcard Weekend matchups for week 14:

Coventry Eagles (3) vs. Nottingham Bandits (6)  
Oxford Pythons (4) vs. Irish Flyers (5)

In the Semi-Finals in week 15, the Packers will play the lowest winning seed from those matchups, while the Spartans will face the higher seed.

### 2020 Rookie Draft

Alas, I am on the outside looking in to the playoffs, so let's stop talking about boring things like that and move on to the exciting bit: the first 6 picks of the 2020 Rookie Draft are now set in stone:

1.01: Flitwick Fireflies  
1.02: Andover Sandslashers  
1.03: Derby Otters  
1.04: Oxford Seahawks  
1.05: Oxford Seahawks (via Hereford Chargers)  
1.06: Flitwick Fireflies (via Wigan Wombats)

Good luck to all those battling it out for the ultimate crown. See you in 2020 ðŸ˜­
