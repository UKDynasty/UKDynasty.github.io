Browns win!! Bills win!!!! Lions win!!! What the hell is going on?

Ties seem to be all the rage at the minute, and our league almost joined the craze. If the Pythons and the Fireflies faced each other this week, then it would have been 80.4 – 80.4. Not sure how ties are sorted (tenuous I know, but let me have it).

All four of the top rookie QBs will be playing in week 4 after Tyrod sacrificed himself and Sam Bradford earned $20m for 2.5 games. It feels like a turning point, like 2014 moving WRs along and 2017 moving the RBs along.

Hands down, the greatest moment of the weekend was Vance McDonald going through Conte. How many times will we see that clip this season?!

### Worst Line-up Decision  

Last week it was suggested that the worst line-up decision was Dermy not playing DJax because if he had done, he would have claimed the highest score in the history of the league. So, congrats Dermy, another much needed trophy.

This week it is another case of a bad decision costing at the top rather than the bottom. I had my Kelly-green coloured glasses on and chose Wentz over Ryan when Wentz’s health was a question and Ryan was going to be in a shootout with the Saints.

However, I’m going to give it to Josh and his Bandits as he made a similar decision at QB, starting Fitz over Brees and that cost him The Buzzsaw. Considering the Bandits record last season, missing a Buzzsaw will hurt more.

### Most Impactful Injury 

Evan Engram is out for a while, but Jonathan should be fine with Gronk is his place. Fournette was held out but that was probably done with a trace of arrogance from the Jags, so Scott shouldn’t have to play both Yeldon and Grant again in Week 4.

The biggest injury is the biggest one in the league. Dermy loses Jimmy G for the year and that might put a dent in his title hopes. He does have the QB12 to replace him with, but he instead has been playing the QB21. Who would you start, Dalton who always bones you or #gradualdecline?

### Closest Matchup 

3 blowouts (49, 49, 37) and 3 tighter results (22.4, 18.5, 13). The winner of the closest matchup goes to Jason and his 13-point win over the reigning champs. Even with Jesse James losing points to Vance “The Destroyer” McDonald, the Chargers got a third of their winning points from just one player and as it has been seen in the UKD finals, 1 player can make all the difference.

### Unluckiest Loser 

Double bad luck for Chris and the Otters as not only did they lose the closest match-up, but they posted the highest losing score. 112 would have been enough to beat half of the league but what Chris has to remember now is that every opponent will see their match up as their UKD final and will raise their game.

### The Buzzsaw

Just like last season, the Flyers win the first 2 Buzzsaws but can’t make it a hat trick. It stays in the North, though, and goes to a former champion who most people thought were fading, the Spartans. They pipped my Eagles by just 0.9 points, but their score was quite comfortable as Chris had 3 of the top 10 QBs this week on his squad!

### Highest Individual Player Score

The highest point scorer was Drew Brees as could have been expected so congrats to the Band… hold on, he was benched. Matt Ryan is up next as the other QB in that game, but he was also benched. Stupid Eagles! Next up is the main recipient of that game, Calvin Ridley with 37 points which led to the classic Twitter joke that the Falcons finally have their number 2 WR, Julio Jones. 

Congrats to the Chargers, maybe next week he is your WR over Pierre Garcon?
