### Worst Line-up Decision

*(WHAT, WHAT, WHAT!)*

A rookie QB in his first regular season start, a player who is 4th in targets for the team and Dermy sees him as a starter. Yep, that is Deonte Thompson. Other options were Nelson Agholor (disappointed in a fellow Eagles fan), Adam Thielen, DJax at the WR position or Njoku and Mixon as the Flex alternatives. It didn’t cost the Flyers but it was a headscratcher!

**Chippenham Packers – 1**  
**Irish Flyers - 1**

### Most Impactful Injury

*(My eyes! The goggles do nothing!)*

Last week was bad but this week stepped up and took down some of the league’s biggest names. JJ Watt is done for the season along with Whitney Mercilus but this isn’t an IDP league and none of us are Texans fans. Chris Conley tore his Achilles (sounds like one of the more painful injuries!). Matt Stafford and Sam Bradford are 2 delicate QBs that are questionable for week 6. Charles Clay will miss a few weeks. DeVante Parker sprained his ankle, Brandon Marshall messed up his ankle as well as Sterling Shepherd which leads to the obvious...

Odell Beckham is done for the year. Something is wrong with the Giants’ ankle tape as their top three receivers all took injuries to their ankles in the game and Beckham’s fracture puts a beautiful (in an Eagles fan’s eye) cherry on a top of the train-wrecked season the Giants are having. The degenerate gamblers in this group would have bet money on it being either the Bandits or the Chargers who had Beckham and it was the aptly name Invalids, that already have 4 players on IR, that has to cope with this.

**Oxford Pythons – 1**  
**Nottingham Bandits (Invalids) - 1**

### Closest Matchup 

*(Sometimes you eat the bar and sometimes, well, the bar eats you.)*

The 0-4 Packers upset the 2-2 Pythons with a victory margin of just 2.1 points! You can’t really fault Olly as not many people would have played McKinnon, Darkwa or Cunningham over Hyde, Howard, Henry or Kroft but that was a lot of points left on the bench. Olly’s optimal line up would have scored 124.9 points and that is an efficiency of 68%, but even 70% efficiency would have won this one and kept the Packers on the track for the Johnny.

**Andover Sandslashers – 1**  
**Oxford Pythons - 1**

### Unluckiest Loser

*(Some days I can’t stop thinking about fantasy football and other days I wonder why I’m wasting my time!)*

The Chargers hit me, the Eagles, when I was at my weakest! 5th highest score of the week faced the 4th highest score of the week. It was the bye weeks that did it with Ryan, Freeman, Julio, Sanu, Anderson, Snead and Kamara unable to play. Started off promisingly with Brate scoring a surprising 15.3 points on TNF but with AJ Green going nuts and Will Fuller getting 2 TDs (if only Tom Savage was playing!) the Chargers took care of business. I mean seriously, if the Falcons and Saints were on different bye weeks, I would have had you Jason! I’m not bitter about being behind Dermy, I’m not. I mean it, I’m not!

**Wigan Wombats – 1**  
**Coventry Eagles - 1**

### The Buzzsaw 

*(You hear that Mr. Dynasty Player?... That is the sound of inevitability... It is the sound of your defeat... Goodbye, Mr. Anderson, I mean opponent...)*

Dermy essentially plays a man down (Zero from Thompson) and still doubles his opponents score! There were 3 undefeated teams in the league but after this week, the Irish Flyers are now the only ones with the 100% record and with the bye weeks on the team fairly spread out, you begin to wonder if they will be the 1972 Dolphins (or hopefully the 2007 Patriots)

**Irish Flyers - 2**

### Highest Individual Player Score 

*(You’re the Best! Around! Nothing’s gonna ever keep you down!)*

Deshaun Watson is driving the Flyers as well as the Texans. I had to check the site a couple of times to make sure I wasn’t looking at the wrong weeks but after getting 33.7 points last week, Watson beats it by getting 35.5! That is a 4 TD game in both Week 4 and in week 5 and he gets to play the Browns this week.

**Irish Flyers – 2**
