### Worst Line-up Decision  

What was I thinking playing Jordan Matthews?! A Thursday night game, he has never topped 8 points, he's been battling niggling injuries... And why don't I listen to my own advice? The Eagles run D is outstanding, so why play CJ Anderson?!! Those poor decisions lead to a 6 point defeat to my what is now becoming bogey team, the Spartans.

But I don't think those were the worst decisions of the week or even the most costly. Scott Westwood believes that Eli Manning is better than Jared Goff right now, and because of that, he lost to Hamza's Championz.

Chippenham Packers – 1  
Irish Flyers – 1  
Oxford Seahawks – 1  
Oxford Pythons – 1  
Wigan Wombats – 1  
**Andover Sandslashers – 1**

### Most Impactful Injury 

It didn't affect the result on the weekend but it will probably have an impact for the rest of the season. Jameis Winston was taken out of the game and is set to miss at least a couple of weeks with a shoulder problem. That leaves the Otters with just QB29 Joe Flacco who is also on a bye in week 10. The Otters currently occupy the final playoff spot in the North, but the Spartans are only 2 games back with 4 weeks to go.

Oxford Pythons – 1  
Nottingham Bandits (Invalids) – 2  
Andover Sandslashers – 1  
Bradford Championz – 1  
**Derby Otters – 1**

### Closest Matchup 

It is becoming a recurring theme now that I'm on the losing end of this. Chris has beaten me again, this time by a more comfortable 5.7 points. Dan's Seahawks were only 8.3 points behind the Otters even though the Otters lost Winston early, so Dan loses in the league and the awards thanks to Marvin Jones.

Andover Sandslashers – 2  
Oxford Pythons – 2  
**Gateshead Spartans – 2**

### Unluckiest Loser 

My Coventry Eagles are running away with this award, as yet again I score over 100 and still lose. Want to know how many times Dermy has faced a team that scored over 100 points? Once! #softnorth

Wigan Wombats – 1

Hereford Chargers – 1  
Derby Otters – 1

### The Buzzsaw

Who would have seen it, who would have predicted it! Hamza's plan looks like it is coming together in time for a playoff push and Scott walked into this 35 point beating. Forte and Lynch rolled back the years to combine for 43 points, and if Hamza had kept confidence in his Greybeards philosophy and played Peterson, the score would have been higher!

Irish Flyers – 3  
Wigan Wombats – 1

### Highest Individual Player Score

There were some unlikely names in the top 10 this week and 4 of them were even on their teams benches (Cutler, Taylor, Clement and Goff). The 2nd highest scorer of the week was Jared Goff in the very enjoyable crushing of the Giants. I thought I had a shot with Wentz having 4 TDs by the 4th quarter but he was then benched. TY Hilton scored 32 points to lead the week and the myth that he only gets points at home was dismissed but the variance is his scoring is crazy!
