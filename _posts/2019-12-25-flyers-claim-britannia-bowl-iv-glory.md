Congratulations to the Irish Flyers, who were worthy champions of the UK Dynasty 2019 season after a 159.88 to 100.34 victory over the Nottingham Bandits in the fourth Britannia Bowl this past weekend. Superstar RB Saquon Barkley, mildly underwhelming in this 2019 season, peaked at just the right time for the Flyers, although they would have still clinched victory even without his 41.9 points (!).

The Flyers' success is the culmination of three hard years of work from owner Dermy McAlinden after [he took over the team]({% post_url 2016-12-15-press-release-new-owner %}) in December of the inaugural season. Since then, he has tirelessly worked, via constant terrible trade offers that sometimes got accepted, to transform the team into the champion we see today.

Credit must also go to Nottingham Bandits' owner Josh Ridge. Josh has sculpted a team of superstars with some shrewd acquisitions over the years, and making a Britannia Bowl is an honour in itself (or so I've heard).

Thanks to all for a great 4th season. Stay tuned in the next few days for 2020 rookie draft order news, but for now, Merry Christmas to all of UKD.
