Yet again, a Britannia Bowl goes down to Monday Night Football, on to an agonising wait until Thursday Morning Stat Corrections.

UK Dynasty's first Week 17 Championship champion is the long-waiting Nottingham Bandits, who went into Monday night with a lead of 22.38 points in the hand and Nick Chubb in the bush, thanks to standout performances from Davante Adams (25.1), Darrel Williams (24.2) and Boston Scott (22.6), over whom Josh had mentioned he was still deliberating on whether to start, moments before Sunday's games kicked off.

Their tough-battling opponents the Oxford Pythons still had Najee Harris to play, and had a huge game from Amon-Ra St Brown to thank for even being in the tie, after he set Sunday evening alight with 100+ yards and 2 touchdowns including [a rare Octopus](https://www.si.com/nfl/2019/03/19/two-point-conversions-introducing-octopus). It looked a lost cause for the Pythons, but if a rib injury early in the game for Chubb opened the door ajar, 200 yards from scrimmage and a touchdown for Harris blew it wide open.

The result, an excruciating 0.08 victory for the Bandits that forced both parties to wait until Thursday [for confirmation](https://fantasy.nfl.com/research/statcorrections#researchStatsCorrections=researchStatsCorrections%2C%2Fresearch%2Fstatcorrections%253Fposition%253DO%2526sort%253Dpts%2526statCategory%253Dstats%2526statSeason%253D2021%2526statType%253DweekStats%2526statWeek%253D17%2Creplace). Peyton Barber? Nope, he wasn't in this final. Christian Blake, Sammis Reyes? Who on Earth are they? [The result is final](https://www80.myfantasyleague.com/2021/weekly?L=11959&W=17). Had the Bandits started any other alternative to Boston Scott, the Oxford Pythons would be Britannia Bowl champion. It's the little things.
