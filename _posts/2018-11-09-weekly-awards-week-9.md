Week 9 had some weird results! Two of the four buzzsaw teams scored below 100 points: the Flyers with 76 and the Otters with 90. The Spartans almost tripled the score of their opponent Fireflies. There was a contender for lowest scoring winner in the league’s history with the Pythons winning with just 82 points. A lot of this can be explained by bye weeks, and that means that week 11 might be even worse.

My Eagles have secured a playoff place as it is impossible to finish any lower than 3rd, but the North looks like a Royal Rumble with the 5th place Wombats still in with a shot of getting a first round bye! If we did the playoffs the ESPN way, 5 teams on the North would be in, which doesn’t bode well for the trophy coming south for the first time.

### Worst Line-up Decision  

I tell you what, this year it has been difficult to criticise our line up decisions. I have to look at all the benches and try and put myself back to the previous Thursday and I find myself agreeing most of the time.

The only 2 decisions I could see this week were my decision to play Michel and Jonathan’s decision to play Cousins over Goff. It was laziness on my part not to swap out Michel for Patterson and I also saw it as high risk, high reward. But Goff in a shootout vs Cousins against the Lions? I think that just edges it.

### Most Impactful Injury 

Proper injuries such as Raheem Mostert and Chris Carson don’t have too much of an impact on their fantasy teams with the Packers having DJ, Jones and Cook and the Flyers having the balls to keep starting LeSean McCoy. The one injury I’d be worried about hasn’t even been set as an injury on the ESPN site and that is Gronk’s. The Patriots like to save players for the end of the season and the playoffs but by then, he won’t be of any use to the Wombats. In a crowded North, the loss of Gronk could be disastrous.

### Closest Matchup 

The closest matchup this week was the bottom of the South slop- fest between the Pythons and the Chargers. 82.5 to 65.8! 82.5 to 65.8! The 9th and 11th highest scores of the week in a matchup settled by just 16.7 points, but in all seriousness, the big names in both teams just didn’t show up with the likes of Hill, Ingram and Peterson held below 11 points each. A dirty win this week Olly!

### Unluckiest Loser 

Here are the Oxford Seahawks scores for the last four weeks: 90.4, 87.4, 81.2, 64.6. Scott must have felt pretty good going into the week and posting a nice score of 109.3, it should have been an easy win but those numbers for Dan were increasing each week and the Falcons backfield destroyed the Washington run defence. 109 would have beaten 7 other teams this week as well.

### The Buzzsaw

With the chance to lock up a playoff position with a win, I had to get serious and put up the highest score of the week. The lack of byes affecting my team helped but 9 TDs from the RB/WR/TE positions (including Julio!) meant that the sitting out of Sony Michel didn’t hurt. I’m hoping Kamara can be the player that pushes my title bid this season like Gurley and Johnson did for the two Chris’ and I have to mention the fact that I got him and a 2nd round pick for DT. Sorry Olly.

### Highest Individual Player Score

Sometimes you watch the highlights of a game and you just realise that there is a player that is certain to win the HPS award. It felt like Michael Thomas was catching everything Drew Brees threw and with a stat line of 211 yards and a TD he got more receiving yards than Flacco, Stafford, Carr, Cousins, Trubisky and Osweiler threw!

Still the curse returns and Tom gets the trophy but not the win!
