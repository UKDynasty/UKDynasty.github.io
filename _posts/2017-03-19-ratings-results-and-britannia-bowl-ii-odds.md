We were pondering what the odds would look like if bookies had a market out for Britannia Bowl II. To aid the creation of such a thing, Sandslasher Scott Westwood conducted a poll of owners asking for their rating of each team in UK Dynasty (you can tell the off-season is in full flow, right?). Results are here:

| Team | Average score | Make playoffs? |
| ---- | ------------- | --------- |
| Coventry Eagles (S) | 8.17 | 100% |
| Wigan Wombats (N) | 7.17 | 91.7% |
| Chippenham Packers (S) | 7.17 | 58.3% |
| Nottingham Bandits (N) | 6.67 | 41.7% |
| Gateshead Spartans (N) | 6.58 | 58.3% |
| Andover Sandslashers (S) | 6.00 | 33.3% |
| Derby Otters (N) | 5.67 | 58.3% |
| Irish Flyers (N) | 5.67 | 50% |
| Oxford Seahawks (S) | 5.33 | 25% |
| Oxford Pythons (S) | 5.08 | 8.3% |
| Bradford Championz (N) | 4.83 | 0% |

Some fun facts:

- The Coventry Eagles scored highly across the board, averaging 8.17, a full point higher than the closest rivals, and were the only team selected as a playoff contender by all 12 owners.
- Only the Oxford Seahawks and Bradford Championz failed to score a single score higher than 7, and the Championz were the only team not selected as a playoff contender by any owner.
- The Bradford Championz were the most controversial team in that they had the wildest range of scores from 1 to 7, but the Irish Flyers and Oxford Pythons also elicited differing opinions, both receiving a smorgasbord of ratings from 3 right up to 8. 
- The Gateshead Spartans were the most consistently graded team, with ten scores of either 6 or 7, and the other two only dropping down to 5 and up to 8.


Using the results and tweaking a bit for divisional bias, here's what I/we think the Britannia Bowl II sportsbook looks like right now:

| Team | Odds |
| ---- | ---- |
| Coventry Eagles | 5/1 |
| Wigan Wombats | 13/2 |
| Nottingham Bandits | 8/1 |
| Chippenham Packers | 9/1 |
| Gateshead Spartans | 10/1 |
| Hereford Chargers | 12/1 |
| Andover Sandslashers | 12/1 |
| Irish Flyers | 14/1 | 
| Derby Otters | 14/1 |
| Bradford Championz | 16/1 |
| Oxford Seahawks | 20/1 |
| Oxford Pythons | 20/1 |
