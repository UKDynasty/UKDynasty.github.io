Before I begin, I feel that I need to address the current, unprecedented situation that is facing the Coventry Eagles franchise.
 
Last week saw a 3rd defeat in a row with the 2nd lowest score of the week. My golden trio of Brown, Julio and Cooks only managed 25 points between them, and too much has been put on the shoulders of the rookie Alvin Kamara who got 22 points by himself. The team was coasting to the playoffs and took its eye of the ball, but that is going to change from this week. We are going to bury the balls, we are going to eat the W and the Flyers are who we thought they were so if you want to crown them, then crown their ass! But, they are who we thought they were, and we aren’t going to let them off the hook!

### Worst Line–up Decision 
 
Four decisions stood out this week but one of them was way more costly than the others. Hamza had to decide between Cam on Thursday vs the Dolphins and Brees @ Bills and you could argue that there wasn’t much between them, it’s just that Cam had a standout fantasy performance and the Saints just ran the ball.

The Pythons chose Josh McCown over Case Keenum for reasons I’m sure Olly will explain to us, but the point difference would not have changed an L to a W.

The Wombats however made a very, very costly error in going with Keenan Allen going up against the Teal Curtain instead of Sammy Watkins going against a deteriorating Texans defense. Those 4 points are the difference between a win and a loss against the undefeated Flyers and for that reason, the Wombats get the award.

Chippenham Packers – 1  
Irish Flyers – 1  
Oxford Seahawks – 1  
Oxford Pythons – 1  
**Wigan Wombats – 2**  
Andover Sandslashers – 1

### Most Impactful Injury 

I’m a little bit torn on this one as I believe there are 2 sets of injuries that make a difference in the coming weeks but one of them had more of an impact this week. The Packers made a bold move and acquired Aaron Jones and Ty Montgomery as they are only 1 game back on the playoff places and they proceed to both get injured in the game this weekend but not before they managed to score some points to help the Packers to a win. Jones is set to miss a few weeks and Montgomery is week to week.

Freeman on the other hand pretty much goes out straight away with a concussion, scores 0.3 points and is doubtful for the upcoming weeks. Seeing as he is the top tier RB on the roster, it hurts my chances of righting the ship, so I’ll give myself and the Packers half an award each.

Oxford Pythons – 1  
Nottingham Bandits (Invalids) – 2  
Andover Sandslashers – 1  
Bradford Championz – 1  
Derby Otters – 1  
**Coventry Eagles – 0.5  
Chippenham Packers – 0.5**

Oxford Pythons – 2  
Gateshead Spartans – 2  
**Wigan Wombats – 1**

### Unluckiest Loser 

WOMBATS! You had a chance! You could have beaten the ~~evil empire~~ dominant Flyers and you tried your best, getting within 1.5 points, but as I said earlier, your decision to go against the Jags defense cost you dearly! Dermy’s closest game before this week was by 18.9 points and the previous week they only scored 77.6, so this was a very unlucky defeat for the Wombats who are now in a battle for with the Spartans and the Otters for the last 2 playoff spots.

**Wigan Wombats – 2**  
Coventry Eagles – 3  
Hereford Chargers – 1  
Derby Otters – 1

### The Buzzsaw

From being the buzzsaw to walking into it, Hamza is a man of extremes with no in-betweens. The Spartans got double digit points from 6 of their players and it could have been better if the Saints scored some of their points through the air rather than just on the ground as that meant Ted Ginn only had 1 catch for 3 yards when the Saints scored 47 points! Robert Woods gets 33.1 points because yet again the opposing team doesn’t fancy tackling him.

Irish Flyers – 3  
Wigan Wombats –1  
Oxford Seahawks – 1  
Bradford Championz – 1  
**Gateshead Spartans – 1**

### Highest Individual Player Score

Cam Newton scored 35.7 points on TNF against a frankly terrible Dolphins team and that had no bearing on our league at all as Hamza had him on his bench. The 20 point gap between him and Brees didn’t ultimately cost Hamza, especially as the 2nd top scorer Robert Woods was on the Spartans, but it has to sting when you have the week’s best player not adding to your total.

Irish Flyers – 3  
Wigan Wombats – 1  
Oxford Seahawks – 1  
Oxford Pythons – 1  
**Bradford Championz – 1**
