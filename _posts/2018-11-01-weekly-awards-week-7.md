### Worst Line-up Decision  

I’ll leave this here:

![Ryan Switzer's 2018 game log]({{site.baseurl}}/images/switzer-week-8-2018.png)

Oxford Pythons – 🏆🏆  
Flitwick Fireflies – 🏆  
Irish Flyers – 🏆  
Nottingham Bandits – 🏆  
Wigan Wombats – 🏆  
Gateshead Spartans – 🏆  
Flitwick Fireflies - 🏆

### Most Impactful Injury 

When it rains, it pours. As the 2nd highest scoring non-QB on the Chargers roster, Will Fuller’s torn ACL is another nail in the coffin of the season which has seen Jason resort to starting the likes of Rishard Matthews. It’s not an injury which changes the UKD league season in terms of playoffs but does impact the top of the 2019 draft.

### Closest Matchup 

[*Do we really need this section this week? **Ed***]

The Seahawks had an embarrassing week, squeaking past the 1-win Chargers by just 3.2 points after a point adjustment for fielding an illegal player. Imagine trying to cheat to beat the (record-wise) worst team in the league!

Oxford Seahawks - 🏆🏆  
Andover Sandslashers - 🏆  
Coventry Eagles - 🏆   
Hereford Chargers - 🏆   
Chippenham Packers - 🏆  
Wigan Wombats - 🏆  
Gateshead Spartans - 🏆  

### Unluckiest Loser 

The Spartans' 146.8 points this week would have earned The Buzzsaw last week. It would have also won it in Week 1 and Week 3, but in Week 8 it was only the 3rd highest score, and unfortunately - if you are in the North - that is probably a 50% chance of a defeat! When 6 teams don’t break 100 and the team above you in the standings (and in the playoffs) scores less than half, you really are the unlucky loser.

Nottingham Bandits – 🏆

Wigan Wombats – 🏆  
Gateshead Spartans - 🏆  

### The Buzzsaw

The 2nd *Chris Bowl* of the season - the 2nd former champions bowl of the season - but the same result as the first, with Shepherd keeping Copeland in his place. But he needed to get the Buzzsaw to make sure! It was also the 3rd highest score of the season. The 3 top teams in the North scored the 3 highest points totals in the league this week.

### Highest Individual Player Score

The curse has been lifted! James Conner scored 35.7 points for the Otters and they won with the Buzzsaw. If Todd Gurley had scored the TD instead of dropping at the 4 yard line, he would have been the highest scorer, but no matter: Chris has him as well!
