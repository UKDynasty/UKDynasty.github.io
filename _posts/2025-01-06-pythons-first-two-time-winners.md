It had to end at some point. After a run of eight different winners in eight seasons from 2016 to 2023, the Oxford Pythons have become the first team to win the Britannia Bowl twice with a 149.32-115.56 victory over 2017 winners the Derby Otters.

The Pythons were led, as has been their modus operandi over the course of the season, by the Ravens duo of Lamar Jackson and Derrick Henry, who combined for over 50 points. Jalen McMillan and Adam Thielen both chipped in with multi-touchdown performances.

It's a much deserved title for the Pythons, who high-scored with 2228.04 points during the regular season, blowing everyone else out of the water with the nearest rival over 300 points behind.

The Otters were let down by pedestrian showings from everyone outside of diamond in the rough Baker Mayfield (34.56 points) and Travis Kelce. Zero touchdowns from Charbonnet, Dowdle, Brian Robinson, Rachaad White, Davante Adams and AJ Brown does not a championship make. 

There's always next year.

The trophy will be presented in Nottingham in February, as ever. Congratulations Pythons.
