It’s all about the playoffs now and results this week have made things a little more interesting.

First, the North. The Irish Flyers and Nottingham Bandits have secured playoff places but the bye is still up for grabs and below them is an interesting race for the final spot. It’s Wombats vs Spartans this week so here are the outcomes for thr deciding week 12:

- WGW win, DOT lose = Wombats secure the last place  
- WGW win, DOT win = GSP out, WGW v NTB and DOT v FF (edge to the DOT)  
- GSP win, DOT win or lose = chaos! WGW v NTB and GSP v IRF for playoff / byes and the Otters might sneak in with a big win over the Fireflies.

In the South, it is just as messy. My Eagles have the bye locked up but the Seahawks, Sandslashers, Pythons and Packers are all in with a shot of the playoffs. 

The Packers do have a distinct advantage as they would have to lose to both Seahawks and the Sandslashers and the Pythons would have to beat my Eagles if they were to miss the playoffs.

As for the other three teams, it’s basically win out or go home which makes the Seahawks v Packers matchup the most interesting of the division.

### Worst Line- up Decision  

I first want to say to Dermy, don’t let your Eagles loyalty cloud your fantasy football judgement! Tate over Tre’Quan? Optimistic at best, foolish at worst.

I’m torn between two either Chris not starting DJ Moore or Scott playing Watson over Eli.

Moore was facing a Lions team who are bad against the pass whilst Sutton was facing a top 5 passing defense in the Chargers. I get starting Woods and Fitz but I might have played the matchup with the rookie receivers as Sutton hasn’t exploded like we thought after the DT trade.

Scott can’t make a right decision at the QB position! Eli vs the very worst defense in the league in the Buccs or Watson against a middle to good Washington? Even Eli could hit OBJ against that secondary (not looking forward to him against the Eagles). Playing Chris Conley would have won the matchup but there is no chance anyone would have started him.

I think this goes to Chris as his decision cost him the week.

### Most Impactful Injury 

Easily the worst injury of the week is Alex Smith’s leg break which apparently happened 33 years to the day, both on the right leg, with the final scores being the same as the Joe Thiesman’s infamous injury. But Dan has been playing Wilson at QB and it shouldn’t affect his season going forward. The injury to Kerryon Johnson might though as it is reported that he will miss 2 weeks (the crucial 2!) and there are a lot of boom or bust RBs on the Seahawks roster to take his place. 

For the Pythons, Olly must be getting sick of hearing about Mariota injuries to his arm. If Gabbert plays instead, that leaves Olly with the choice of Lamar Jackson (is Flacco back?) or Case Keenum to face my Eagles. 

Seeing as how Mariota is QB27 and Keenum is QB25, I think Dan wins the award for either Kerryon or Smith, it’s up to him [*Thanks... - **Ed***].

### Closest Matchup 

Just to show how close this playoff race was, the two divisional matchups in the North that mattered (sorry Michael) were decided by 5.3 and 5.5 points. The Wombats beat the Otters by the closer margin thanks to Goff throwing it all night instead of handing it off to Gurley.

### Unluckiest Loser 

The Spartans put up a brave fight in their bid to secure a playoff place against their division rival Bandits but Chris felt that feeling every fantasy player gets: the complete unfairness and rage at getting the 4th highest score of the week but still losing. He gets that score against either the Otters or Wombats and the playoffs are almost wrapped up, instead it’s a must win game against the Wombats in week 12 without Mahomes.

### The Buzzsaw

It’s an empty Buzzsaw win for my Eagles this week, I had Wentz in my starting line up and he scored only 0.8 points. Luckily all my pass catchers scored over 20 points, with TY Hilton going especially crazy and AB waking up in the 4th quarter. 

The top three scoring teams this week were the teams with the best records which could make for some interesting playoffs.

### Highest Individual Player Score

Top three scorers came from the same game and you’ll probably be surprised to see that the QBs weren’t at the top. Goff and Mahomes (how far they have come since the summer of 2017!) both scored 35 points but it was Tyreek Hill who outscored them with 38 points; that was 40% of Olly’s total and gave him enough to topple Scott and keep the South interesting.
