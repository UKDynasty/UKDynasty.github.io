### Worst Line-up Decision

*(Mr. Dynasty Player, what player you’ve just picked is one of the most insanely idiotic things I have ever heard. At no point in your rambling, incoherent lineup were you even close to anything that could be considered a rational team. Everyone in this room is now dumber for having seen to it. I award you no points, and may God have mercy on your soul.)*

There were a few head scratchers this week: Kizer over Stafford for the Packers was interesting. Is Tom trying to replicate last year’s successful formula for the team he took over by not altering his line up? It worked last year, but this week it contributed to a 0-4 record. On the other side of the matchup, I trade for Kamara then bench him in favour of Bernard? My thinking on this one was that I was going to be sitting next to a Dolphins fan at Wembley and didn’t want to be cheering if Kamara broke off a big play.

Finally, Old Man Palmer over Prescott/Smith for the Spartans. I mention this because Smith makes it a win for the Spartans and doesn’t give the Championz their first win of the season. Not the worst decision but probably the most impactful!

**Chippenham Packers - 1**

### Most Impactful Injury

*(Football in the groin! Football in the Groin!)*

This was a big week for injuries and here are some that happened either during the game or just leading up to it: Eagles (Julio, Carr, Sanu, Snead, Matthews), Championz (Abdullah, Adams, Forte, Perkins), Spartans (Crabtree), Invalids (Montgomery, OBJ, Burkhead, Williams), Flyers (Carson), Seahawks (Prosise, Davis), Pythons (Mariota, Cook, Doyle).

The most impactful has to be the season-ending injury to Dalvin Cook for the Pythons. Cook was one of the league’s top rushers before Sunday and had 12 points by the time he tore his ACL which still makes him a top 10 RB after 4 games. Olly has to hope that McKinnon can step into Cook’s role for both the Vikings and the Pythons.

**Oxford Pythons - 1**

### Closest Matchup

*(To that one soul who is reading this, I know you are tired, you’re fed up, you’re so close to breaking but there’s strength within you even when you feel weak. Keep fighting!)*

The Sandslashers beat the Pythons by 11.3 points which compared the week 3 (0.6 points), week 2 (3.1 points) and week 1 (2.3 points) was quite a wide margin.

**Sandslashers - 1**

### Unluckiest Loser

*(That was a close one ladies and gentleman. Unfortunately in every contest, there must be a loser. Loo-hoo-ser-her)*

The Invalids are having the definition of a bad luck season! Week 1 they would have beat 6/10 teams, week 2 they would have beat 5/10, week 3 they would have beaten 7/10 and week 4 they would have beaten 4/10. If you look at the points against them so far this season (478) compared to the Flyers (371) and especially the Otters (293), then you can understand the 0-4 start.

But this week’s unluckiest loser are the Wigan Wombats who walked into the Flyer’s buzz saw. 102.8 points would have beaten seven other teams. Melvin Gordon only scored 3.4 points (Eagles run D is legit!) and Sammy Watkins only got 2.2 points in a game where the Rams scored 35! The Wombats are 2 games back instead of one now.

**Wigan Wombats - 1**

### T-800

*(It can't be bargained with. It can't be reasoned with. It doesn't feel pity or remorse or fear and it absolutely will not stop EVER until you are beaten)*

The Irish Flyers maintain their unbeaten record in style with the week’s highest points total and that was after the acquisition of Zeke, although Miller got 27.1 points so the boost was less than a point. Dermy looks almost unstoppable as he has won by a comfortable margin every week (at least 20 points) and battle with the also undefeated Otters is going to be a good one!

**Irish Flyers - 1**

### Highest Individual Player Score

*(By the Power of Greyskull… I have the POWER!)*

Deshaun Watson, welcome to the NFL. 43% of his season’s points so far game in the game against the Titans. Dermy doesn’t need the week’s top scorer to win though, he will take the piss and play Andy Dalton instead!

**Irish Flyers – 1**
