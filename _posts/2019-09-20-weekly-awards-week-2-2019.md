Quarterback is meant to be the draft, forget and set position in fantasy football. There are 32 starters whilst there are only 12 of us in the league so once you have drafted your senior vet Brady, Brees or Rivers, you just make sure you have someone for bye weeks or maybe a rookie to sell in the future. Week three will have ~25% of NFL teams starting someone other than the man that started week 1. 

Foles is out and certain Jags fans might like Minshew more if/when he comes back, Brees is out for 6 weeks at least with a torn thumb ligament and this is now Teddy’s chance to see if he is the heir, Big Ben snapped a UCL (I'd heard of ACL, MCL but not UCL) and at 37 is at risk if Rudolph shows promise, Eli has finally been put out of his misery and replaced with his Mini-Me, Luck got sick of being hurt, Cam can’t do any of the things that made him Cam and the curse that is on the Jets has given their starting QB a childhood disease and torn the ligaments of their back up!

As you may have seen from my messages last week, I spent a few days in Longmont, Colorado and it made me realise just how massive the NFL is over there. The radio ads were about free coffee if the Broncos won, the weather report always mentioned the weather on Sunday at the end for the tailgaters, every shop had some sort of Broncos clothing or memorabilia available (got me a genuine Broncos DT jersey for $40!). I thought it was the equivalent of football over here, but it is much, much bigger - it gets into everyone’s lives over there, whether you like the game or not. And sports bars! If we keep this league going for a few more years, I say we club together and open a bar dedicated to NFL with 12 TVs for every live game and RedZone, serve pizza and wings, and plaster the walls with team jerseys. When the first one is a success, we open new ones but only in our towns! Sound good?

### The Buzzsaw - Chippenham Packers

The Packers have come to play! 143.7 points leads the week and means they have started 2-0 in the South division and they have the highest total points scored for the season so far. Having double D’s is usually helpful getting what you want and the Packer’s DDs (Dalvin and Dak) put up over 50 points by themselves to get them the buzzsaw award.

### Highest Point Scorer - Flitwick Fireflies

If you had to guess who the top scorer would be each week, you wouldn’t be crazy to thing that it would be a Kansas City Chief. Mahomes, Williams, Watkins or Kelce would be the more obvious choices but Demarcus Robinson?? The Fireflies Demarcus Robinson?! His 172 yards last week accounted for 25% of his total career yards and this is his 4th season!!
Michael pulled off some amazing skills by signing him for $0 and putting him straight into his starting line-up. I’m expecting Damiere Byrd to go crazy this weekend.

### Unluckiest Loser - Andover Sandslashers

When you come at the king, you best not miss. Scott and his Sandslashers put up the third highest score of the week but he was playing yours truly who managed the second highest score of the week (painfully thanks in large part to the Eagles secondary taking terrible angles on Julio’s long TD). Mark Andrews may be the breakout TE of the 2019 season, but the Jags managed to tame Deshaun Watson and AP and Lindsay are suffering in their time shares which tempered the Sandslasher total.

### Closest Matchup - Oxford Seahawks

This one was a doozey!!! It’s a story about tight ends as the Seahawks got a big, fat zero from supposed breakout candidate, OJ Howard in the Thursday game (that’s why I hate having players on Thursdays) and so just one 11 yard catch by Njoku on Monday night would have pushed the Spartans ahead of the Seahawks for the win. It would be annoying if he was ruled out before the game, it would have been frustrating if he hadn’t been targeted but to get injured in the very play that would have gotten the needed points? I would have woken all my kids with the screams of rage on Tuesday morning if that had happened to me (LSD-style flashbacks to Britannia Bowl I). 1.58 points, devastating.

### Most Impactful Injury - Gateshead Spartans

Take your pick from any of the QB injuries. 

Big Ben? Dermy has Jimmy G and 2nd placed Andy Dalton as backups.

Brees? Josh has only got Aaron Rodgers who hasn’t been an ironman in recent seasons and there are bye weeks coming
Tevin Coleman doesn’t hurt the Pythons depth; Jackson doesn’t really hurt the Flyers either. The truly most impactful injury was the aforementioned Njoku injury. It wasn’t the most gruesome, it isn’t a season ended, but it did cost the Spartans a win and it leaves Chris with just Jimmy Graham who also didn’t score last week, and he is facing the league leading Packers.

### Worst Decision - TBA

I’ve left this week’s award to the last minute due to work and family commitments and because of that, MFL has flipped everything to week 3 making it very hard for me to see who scored what last week, so I’m opening it up to suggestions.
