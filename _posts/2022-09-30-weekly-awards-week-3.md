NFL in the UK!!!!

I’ll be heading down to the game this weekend and I’ll be wearing a Vikings jersey as every Saints loss is a great thing for the Eagles. If anyone else is there, let me know as I’ll be wandering around with my wife as she hasn’t been to a game before and one of you can tell her how important our league is (Christmas depends on it) and writing awards is more important than putting children to bed!!!!

### The Buzzsaw

Ooh this was a close one, with just 0.02 points difference between the second place Bandits and the first place Sandslashers! The Sandslashers are this week’s buzzsaw with a score of 132.3 and the impressive thing is that it wasn’t due to one player having a crazy week but with solid scoring across the board. Seven out of nine players were in double digits, James Robinson, Devin Singletary, Zay Jones and Chris Olave all scored 19 points and it could even have been better if more Jags current or former players were in the line up.

What is also impressive is the improvement week on week, going from 82 points to 104 points to now 132 points. Topping 150 this week???

### Highest Point Scorer

If you don’t have a QB, you don’t have anything. Why or why are the Ravens not giving Lamar every dollar he is asking for? The Pythons reap the benefits of another 100 yard + TD rushing performance and a couple of hundred yards with 4 thrown TDs in as well. 39.4 points in week three isn’t quite as good as week two but was a full 10 points more than the 2nd highest scorer this week and I bet nobody but Dan would guess who that was. Khalil Herbert is the answer with “just” 29.9 points followed by surprise breakout player of the season so far, Jalen Hurts.

That’s three in a row for the Pythons who win the Oxford derby comfortably and take the lead in the south.

### Unluckiest Loser

In the south, the Beavers knew they had to have a better week in week 3 than they did in week 2 to stand any chance against the Sandslashers and going from 69 points to 119 points was enough for the 4th highest score of the week and would have beaten the Sandslashers in weeks 1 and 2. But this week the Sandslashers put up a buzzsaw and that flip-flops them in the standings. The efficiency ratings show that it would have been possible to sneak the win, but I don’t think starting Mariota, Edmonds, Dortch and Reynolds over Stafford, Javonte, Diontae and Pittman is a winning formula every week.

It was a strong showing for the South, 3 of the top 4 positions taken by them (Seahawks in 11th).

### Worst Decision

Not much to choose from this week, good work everyone!

Flacco against the Bengals vs Jones against the Ravens for the Spartans maybe? Flacco looks done and that game against the Browns is one of those weird events that shouldn’t be expected to repeat itself. Mac Jones would have a higher floor in my opinion but with the injury, that is a moot point now.
Eno over Connor for the Otters was almost a game-coster but Benjamin’s 3.3 were just enough to edge over the line.

I think the Spartans decision was worse but the Otter’s decision had the (almost) bigger impact. Sorry Shep, Chris takes it.

### Closest Matchup

Sorry again Shep! I confused myself last week and got caught up in giving myself awards. The winner of the closest matchup should get the award, and as my record shows, I did not win. Not this week, not last week, nor the week before.

I can also make it a double award for the Otters as they  snuck past their opponent, the Cobras, again and this time by just 2 points which was by far the closest matchup of the week. Even with an efficiency rating of just 76% and the Cobras at 94%, a win is a win and the Otters are joint top of the Midlands.

### Most Impactful Injury

David Montgomery going out early and then Herbert performing well, probably means that the Bears backfield might look a little different for a while and my Eagles can not really afford to lose “quality” players if I’m to finally win a game this season.

The Spartans had a choice between Mac Jones and Joe Flacco whilst they waited for Watson to make his Browns debut, but Jones has a high ankle sprain which will side-line him for several weeks at least. Flacco probably played himself out a start in week 4 as Zach Wilson looks to be rushed back.

The Wombats were probably hoping that Tua would carry on his breakout year (a la Jalen Hurts, yea I’m saying it again, I need this!!!) but that “back” injury might limit him in a TNF match up with the Bengals. So who to start, Herbert with his bad ribs or Geno with is bad play?

Spartans take it as they might not have a starter at a position this week.
