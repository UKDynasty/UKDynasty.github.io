The wait is over to find out who your team will be facing in week 1 and beyond.

As in past seasons, all teams will face the other five teams in their division twice, with the other three matchups against teams from the opposing division. Previously, those teams were chosen arbitrarily, but from 2018 onwards, they will be selected based on where teams finished the previous season. See the [updated bylaws](/bylaws#21-regular-season) for more details.

A grudge match in the North in the opening week sees reigning champions the Derby Otters kick off their title defense against 2016 champions the Gateshead Spartans in what promises to be a spicy affair, while the recently relocated Flitwick Fireflies begin their campaign against last season's North runners-up the Wigan Wombats.

In the South, we'll see 2017 divisional champions and two-time Britannia Bowl runners-up (@Phil at least I didn't say 'losers') the Coventry Eagles go up against last season's 6th-placed Andover Sandslashers, who will look to overturn the odds and start off with a win on the way to improving on their 4-9 record in 2017.

The full 13 week schedule can be seen [on ESPN here](http://games.espn.com/ffl/schedule?leagueId=7168), but the tables below will tell you everything you need to know, too, in a harder-to-read-yet-more-compact format.
