Busy work week guys, so this week is late and without much comment at the start.

### The Buzzsaw - Nottingham Bandits

Week 6 brought everyone back down with a bump after the craziness of week 5. The average score was around 10 points lower than the week before and the relative spread was a lot closer, 17% compared to 35% meaning this week was a lot more competitive. At the start of the season, the Bandits were rated as the strongest dynasty team in the league by FantasyPros and they flexed their muscles this week to get the highest score of 145.42 which they needed to get against my (aging) Eagles.

### Highest Point Scorer - Derby Otters

Should this one be allowed? The Otters sleepwalked into having the highest point scorer of the week in Stefon Diggs, who scored 4.7, 9.4, 3, 12.3 and 5.9 before putting up the only 40+ score in week 6. Saying that, the Eagles secondary is being manned by the worlds slowest and clueless cornerbacks so maybe Shep knew what he was doing and knew he would do enough to win his matchup and mock the leaders of the South?

It’s also crazy that there were only 2 other players that got into the 30’s and that was barely done by Matt Ryan and Lamar Jackson.

### Unluckiest Loser - Coventry Eagles 

In a week where only half the teams managed to break the 100 point barrier, 2 of them didn’t win their matchups. The Sandslashers got the 4th highest score of the week but faced the 2nd highest score week from the Spartans…… however I put up the 3rd highest score and that wasn’t enough as I was playing against the Buzzsaw Bandits. Fecking, feck feck!

(Sorry Dan for what I am about to do) The Seahawks win with 91 points and move to the same record as me and 2 games ahead of the Sandslashers. Lucky winners and unlucky losers!

### Closest Matchup - Oxford Seahawks 

Bear with me here people, I’m about to tell a story.

The Seahawks went into Monday Night Football vs the Fireflies down by 19.2 points with Kerryon Johnson and MVS still to play and the Fireflies done. 

As the last Packers drive started, Kerryon had 13.1 points and MVS had 6 which totalled 19.1 points and Dan was staring at a 0.1 point loss until... MVS hauled in a 2 yard pass which gave him 0.2 points for the yards and 0.5 points for the reception and a 0.1 point loss became a 0.6 point win. 

That little 2 yard allowed Dan to catch up with the Packers at the top of the South and it rooted Mike to the bottom of the league. Wonder how important it will be by the end of the season.

### Most Impactful Injury - Derby Otters

Will Dissley was the TE surprise of the season, being the number 5 overall for the season being above the likes of Kittle and Ertz but his season has been cut short by an achilles tear. That means the Otters are down to Kyle Rudolph and Dallas Goedert who are TE49 and TE35. Maybe yet another move the UKD trade ho, Greg Olsen?

The Chargers have 8 WR on their roster and only 2 of them don’t have any injury concerns, Chark and Ridley. Amari Cooper is one of those concerns as he looks likely to miss week 7 at least and that might mean if Will Fuller doesn’t get healthy, that Jason can’t even field his minimum 3 receivers!

I think I give this one to the Otters

### Worst Decision - Wigan Wombats

Kirk Cousins had been taunted by an Eagles LB, the Eagles secondary is a joke and the Vikings WRs have been demanding more balls. It was a perfect recipe for a large score and Cousins put up a healthy 27 points. Benching him over Jared Goff who was playing against the 2nd ranked defense this season didn’t cost the Wombats but it kept the score close.
