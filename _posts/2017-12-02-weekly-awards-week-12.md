Where did the regular season go?! Only 1 week left and in the North the playoffs have been decided, with the Flyers getting the bye and the Otters facing off against the Wombats to reach the divisional final. In the South it is a little more open still. If the Seahawks can win and score 200 points more than my losing Eagles, then they can get the 1st round bye, otherwise they settle for a certain playoff spot against either the Chargers, Pythons or Packers.

Can we all give a round of applause the Chris and his Otters? 

Trade deadline on the 7th don’t forget!

### Worst Line-up Decision  

Scott decided to risk Greg Olsen instead of playing Hunter Henry and that decision was the difference between a win and a loss. Suspicious, as the Sandslashers need a loss for draft position and the Seahawks need the win for the playoffs???? (note for ed: I’m only joking, please don’t dock any points/wins)

Olly keeping faith in Mariota is bizarre (*HOMER - Ed*) when he has November's offensive player of the month on his bench in Keenum, but it would have only won the closest matchup award instead of the actual match.

Chippenham Packers – 1  
Irish Flyers – 1  
Oxford Seahawks – 1  
Oxford Pythons – 1  
Wigan Wombats – 2  
**Andover Sandslashers – 2**  
Gateshead Spartans – 1

### Most Impactful Injury 

Fairly low key on the injury front in terms of fantasy value but the one that could affect the playoffs is the injury to Amari Cooper. He took a big hit and got an ankle injury and a concussion from it, so is questionable for the foreseeable future which is a shame as he could have been receiving the suspended Crabtree's targets. How do you injury the top and bottom of your body at the same time? It’s not like he was drunk in a shower!

Oxford Pythons – 1  
Nottingham Bandits (Invalids) – 2  
Andover Sandslashers – 1  
Bradford Championz – 1  
Derby Otters – 1  
Coventry Eagles – 0.5  
Chippenham Packers – 1.5  
**Oxford Seahawks – 1**

### Closest Matchup
 
A slug match is the best way to describe the Sandslashers v Seahawks matchup. Players for both teams either scored very well or very badly, not much in between. Fournette’s nagging ankle meant he only scored 5.7 but Alfred Morris couldn’t take advantage and only got 5.4 because of Rod Smith. Goff and Wilson scored well, Davis got a zero, Coleman scored 21, Olsen isn’t fit and got 1.5. You could not predict the winner until it was over and the Seahawks scraped a 7 point win to seal their playoff position.

Andover Sandslashers – 2  
Oxford Pythons – 2  
Gateshead Spartans – 2  
Wigan Wombats – 1  
**Oxford Seahawks – 1** 

### Unluckiest Loser 

It was always going to take a bit of luck to stop the Flyers unbeaten season so far and even though they put up the 8th highest score in week 12 they lost to the Otters who sealed their playoff place. Well done Otters, you have won the championship belt and the hearts of the rest of the league for giving us belief that the Flyers can be stopped! (At least until Zeke comes back.)

Wigan Wombats – 2  
Coventry Eagles – 3  
Hereford Chargers – 1  
Derby Otters – 1  
Gateshead Spartans – 1  
**Irish Flyers – 1** 

### The Buzzsaw

3 losses in a row are behind me now and this week my Eagles had the 3 top scorers for the week in Julio, AB and Kamara, to post a record 184 points and that was even with Crabtree scoring nothing due to his fight with Talib. The poor Chargers didn’t stand a chance, especially with Jordy Nelson irrelevant with Brett Hundley as his QB and Rishard Matthews laying a goose egg, but any team in the history of the league would have lost this week.

Irish Flyers – 3  
Wigan Wombats – 1  
Oxford Seahawks – 1  
Bradford Championz – 1  
Gateshead Spartans – 1  
**Coventry Eagles – 2**

### Highest Individual Player Score

Oh Julio Jones you beauty! 44.8 points from 12 catches for 253 yards and 2 TDs, one of which came from a bomb thrown by Sanu! The top three all belonged to my Eagles team with AB getting 35.9 points and Alvin Kamara getting 33.8, but Robby Anderson was a surprise in the top 5. Joe Mixon broke the top 12 to repay the faith of the owners that wouldn’t trade him earlier in the season…

Irish Flyers – 3  
Wigan Wombats – 1  
Oxford Seahawks – 1  
Oxford Pythons – 1  
Bradford Championz – 1  
**Coventry Eagles – 2**
