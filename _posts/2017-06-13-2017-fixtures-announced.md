Find out who you'll be facing in each of the 13 weeks of the UK Dynasty regular season below. The fixtures are also available to view on [MyFantasyLeague](https://www73.myfantasyleague.com/2017/options?L=61991&O=15), and they'll be transferred over to our ESPN league in the near future.

Each team plays every other team in their own division twice, which amounts to 10 games. The remaining 3 games are inter-divisional games, played against 3 teams from the opposite division.

This season, you'll face whichever 3 teams from your rival division that you didn't come up against last season. From next season onwards, the teams you face will be decided by a ranking-based system.

The inter-divisional weeks are the same week numbers as 2016 - weeks 3, 7 and 9.
