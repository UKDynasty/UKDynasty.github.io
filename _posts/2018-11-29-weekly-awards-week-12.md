It is the last week of the fantasy regular season and for half of the league it is the last game of the year. How the hell does it go by so quickly?! How different does everything NFL feel now? 

Massive matchups in Week 12 mean that almost everything is still to play for. The bye in the North is still between the Flyers and the Bandits (but pretty much sealed by Dermy), there is a wildcard in the North available and two in the South. The first overall pick in 2019 rookie draft is still between Michael and Jason but what that really means is... who gets the Johnny?

### Worst Line- up Decision  

Can’t find one! I started with the closer matchups and there is nothing that would have made a difference. I then looked at all the teams to see if there was anything which stood out and nothing. Not even a shot at a top score or anything like that.

Let me know what to do with the award this week!

Wigan Wombats - 🏆🏆  
Gateshead Spartans - 🏆🏆  
Oxford Pythons - 🏆🏆  
Oxford Seahawks - 🏆  

### Most Impactful Injury 

Simple one this week and it could have major repercussions for how the North playoffs progress, making the bye week even more important. Melvin Gordon might be missing for a couple of weeks which isn’t so bad for the LA Chargers, but it's right when Dermy needs him the most. Couple that with Dalton on IR and Brady being questionable, it could get rough for the Flyers.

### Closest Matchup 

It was simple, if Tom’s Packers could beat Dan’s Seahawks, the playoffs in the South were signed, sealed and delivered. If Dan wanted to keep his slim chances alive he has to go an a back to back win streak against the Packers and then the Pythons in week 13. 

13 points were the difference and the playoffs are still up for grabs.

### Unluckiest Loser 

The Wombats would have beaten anybody from the South, they would have beaten the Fireflies and the Otters. Jonathan had the 4th highest score of the week and instead of all but wrapping up a playoff place, he's on the outside looking in and needs to beat the 2nd placed Bandits to keep playing this season. Sometimes you just hate fantasy football, right Jonathan?

### The Buzzsaw

The North means business! The Spartans needed a win and posted 153.1 points to make sure, which was the 3rd highest score. The Bandits and the Flyers are fighting for the relief of the bye week so they put up the top 2 scores, and Dermy’s Flyers had the highest with 164.4 points. As a member of the South, I’m worried about the chances of getting the trophy down this way.

### Highest Individual Player Score

At this time of year, there is a running back who steps up and drags their team all the way to glory. In previous years it was Gurley and Johnson and this year, and this year McCaffrey looks like he has turned it on at just at the right time for Chris and the Spartans. 41 points this week after 100 yards rushing and receiving, and a 3rd 30+ points haul in the last 4 weeks.
