The most important news of the season comes around this time of year - not who won the championship, but who is holding which pick in the rookie draft. Wait no longer, because here's the order of picks for the 2020 Draft:

1: Flitwick Fireflies  
2: Andover Sandslashers  
3: Derby Otters  
4: Oxford Seahawks  
5: Hereford Chargers  
6: Wigan Wombats  
7: Oxford Pythons  
8: Coventry Eagles  
9: Gateshead Spartans  
10: Chippenham Packers  
11: Nottingham Bandits  
12: Irish Flyers

That means, due to ferocious trading of first rounders, that the first round looks a little like this:

1.01: Flitwick Fireflies  
1.02: Andover Sandslashers  
1.03: Derby Otters  
1.04: Oxford Seahawks  
1.05: Oxford Seahawks (via Hereford Chargers)  
1.06: Flitwick Fireflies (via Wigan Wombats)  
1.07: Oxford Pythons  
1.08: Wigan Wombats (via Coventry Eagles)  
1.09: Oxford Seahawks (via Gateshead Spartans)  
1.10: Andover Sandslashers (via Chippenham Packers)  
1.11: Wigan Wombats (via Nottingham Bandits)  
1.12: Hereford Chargers (via Irish Flyers)

The draft will take place (provisionally, barring any jailtime, rules changes, or jury duty, mountain climbing notwithstanding) on Saturday 30th May.

**Reminders**

Trading will re-open on the Monday after the Super Bowl.
