Just an hour before going on the clock for the first overall pick of the 2018 draft, the Nottingham Bandits have sent shockwaves through the league by trading the pick to the Irish Flyers.

Rumours had been circling in the days leading up to the draft as to a possible trade between the two franchises, with Flyers running back Ezekiel Elliott reported to be involved in the negotiations as a possible trade piece.

The Flyers did give up Elliott in the trade, along with second, third and fourth round picks this year (2.01, 3.06 and 4.10) and their 2019 3rd round pick. The Bandits added wide receiver John Brown and Seattle Seahawks backfield-ingredient Mike Davis to sweeten the 1.01, and the deal was done with an hour to spare.

The Bandits front office refused to comment on the trade at this time, cryptically suggesting that they may have something to say publicly at a later date.

The Flyers were unavailable for comment, but when the clock strikes midday it will be their name on the 1.01 ticket.
