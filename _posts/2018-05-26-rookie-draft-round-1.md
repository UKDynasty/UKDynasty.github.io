## Day 1 - Saturday 25th May 2018

### Pick 1 - Irish Flyers, Saquon Barkley

As the clock ticked over to midday, crescendo turned to anticlimax as the Irish Flyers front office were otherwise engaged. It took 150 minutes for word to come out that the Flyers weren't going to pull any surprises, selecting Saquon Barkley with the pick that they acquired via trade in dramatic fashion just an hour before the draft began.

### Pick 2 - Hereford Chargers, Derrius Guice



### Pick 3 - Andover Sandslashers, Ronald Jones II

The Slashers made their first of two picks in the top five, selecting Tampa Bay RB Ronald Jones at 1.03. 

### Pick 4 - Wigan Wombats, Rashaad Penny

With the first trade during the draft, the Wigan Wombats gave up receiver Jarvis Landry, pick 3.10 and their 2019 2nd round pick to steal away this pick from 2016 champs the Gateshead Spartans.

"We knew going into the draft that we had to trade up to help fill our biggest need at running back, and we found a willing trade partner at 1.04." said owner Jonathan Moffatt. "The Seahawks have a good track record with producing fantasy-relevant running backs, so hopefully Penny fulfils his potential."

"The Wombats war room is very pleased with today's work and will now be heading off to the pub to celebrate."
