## Day 1 - Saturday 25th May 2018

### Pick 1 - Irish Flyers, Saquon Barkley

As the clock ticked over to midday, crescendo turned to anticlimax as the Irish Flyers front office were otherwise engaged. It took 150 minutes for word to come out that the Flyers weren't going to pull any surprises, selecting Saquon Barkley with the pick that they acquired via trade in dramatic fashion just an hour before the draft began.

The Flyers management have been unavailable for comment due to other commitments (congratulations), but there's little to say other than that Barkley is the most sure-thing 1.01 rookie pick since the last sure-thing 1.01 rookie pick.

### Pick 2 - Hereford Chargers, Derrius Guice

No NFL draft-style fall for Derrius here. Taken as the seventh running back off the board by Washington in April's Dallas showpiece, Guice was obviously valued higher by the Chargers, who jumped at the chance to select him at second overall.

"I liked what I saw out of him in college and feel he will be leading that backfield soon." said Chargers owner Jason Reese. "We have high hopes for him."

Guice slots into an RB-needy Hereford backfield led by Isaiah Crowell, Latavius Murray and a selection of backs with the surname Williams.

### Pick 3 - Andover Sandslashers, Ronald Jones II

The Slashers made their first of two picks in the top five, selecting Tampa Bay RB Ronald Jones. 

### Pick 4 - Wigan Wombats, Rashaad Penny RB

With the first trade during the draft, the Wigan Wombats gave up receiver Jarvis Landry, pick 3.10 and their 2019 2nd round pick to steal away this pick from 2016 champs the Gateshead Spartans.

"We knew going into the draft that we had to trade up to help fill our biggest need at running back, and we found a willing trade partner at 1.04." said owner Jonathan Moffatt. "The Seahawks have a good track record with producing fantasy-relevant running backs, so hopefully Penny fulfils his potential."

"The Wombats war room is very pleased with today's work and will now be heading off to the pub to celebrate."

### Pick 5 - Andover Sandslashers, Sony Michel RB

The Sandslashers' front office have a tumultuous relationship with the real-life New England Patriots, but that didn't stop them zeroing in on first-round running back Sony Michel with their second pick of the top five.

Michel staked his claim for being a coveted rookie pick with some electrifying performances as part of the shared Georgia backfield with Nick Chubb (see Pick 6), and the Slashers obviously shared the Patriots' opinions on the 23-year-old.

### Pick 6 - Nottingham Bandits, Nick Chubb RB

**TRADE**. The Bandits moved up one pick from 1.07 for a pick-swap, and gave up their 2019 3rd for the pleasure. 

The Georgia backfield go back-to-back(field). Chubb has been in the top 6 rookie pick discussion since he first stepped onto the field as a freshman, and even a (really) gruesome knee injury in 2015 didn't derail that narrative. In the weeks leading up to the NFL draft, the prospect of Saquon Barkley landing in Cleveland, and the effect of that on his value if any, was an oft-discussed topic. But it was Chubb, not Barkley, that landed in a three-way committee with Carlos Hyde and Duke Johnson.

 "In terms of landing spot Chubb got a really bad one, on a perennially bad team that happens to already have 2 good RBs, but in terms of talent I think he is possibly the best RB in the draft aside from Barkley, and has been underrated due to the terrible injury he got in college, which as far as I can tell is fully recovered from." Bandits GM Josh Ridge explained. "He had a good combine so it doesn't seem to be holding him back. I had tried to trade up to 4 to take him, and then 5, and was happy to pay my 3rd next year to move up a single spot to ensure I got him. I am optimistic that he'll be a starter by next season."

### Pick 7 - Hereford Chargers, Calvin Ridley WR

"I'll be honest, I had no idea who to pick," Chargers GM Jason Reese admitted candidly. "But on research, I felt that his pairing with Ryan and Jones would be a great chance for him to excel."

### Pick 8 - Oxford Seahawks, Kerryon Johnson RB

With a fairly sparse running back corps and the recent Mark Ingram suspension news exacerbating that, the Seahawks dipped their toe into the RB market with the 8th overall pick, selecting the Lions' Kerryon Johnson.

"We watched a lot of Kerryon in college at Auburn and the way he balled out in the SEC and looked like a top back even through injury convinced us that he was worth a top 3 pick in this draft" said Seahawks boss Dan Abrey. "We're very pleased to nab him at pick 8 and look forward to watching him in the NFL."

### Pick 9 - Andover Sandslashers, Christian Kirk WR



### Pick 10 - Nottingham Bandits, Royce Freeman RB

Having traded out of the chance to add a theoretical generational talent to their RB corps at 1.01, the Bandits paired Nick Chubb with Oregon/Denver RB Royce Freeman with the 10th overall pick.

"Aside from Barkley I felt that the other top seven RBs were all pretty close in value. I was very happy to get Chubb in particular, but otherwise was happy to get whoever fell to 10, if any of them were left." Ridge said. "My team has a lot of young WRs who have already shown promise on the field so I was happy to prioritise RB out of that tier of players."

### Pick 11 - Gateshead Spartans, D.J. Moore WR

The first receiver off the board in the NFL draft, Moore had to wait for his turn behind Ridley and Kirk in the UK Dynasty version. 

Moore adds some much-needed youth to a Spartans receiving corps that stars ageing elites Julian Edelman and Larry Fitzgerald.

Spartans top brass Chris Copeland said "As the draft went by we saw plenty of opportunities to pull the trigger on trades both back and forward to get players we wanted. We are more than happy to have welcomed Jarvis (Landry) to the Spartan army early in the draft, and now to add DJ into the fold the Spartans are ecstatic."

"He joins his team mate Christian McCaffrey as the only rookies to be taken in the 1st round in Spartans history and we hope he can have as much success as his fellow Panther during his time in Gateshead".

### Pick 12 - Oxford Seahawks, Michael Gallup WR
