After the first of our divisional deciders, you can already throw last week's article out of the window. Situations have changed across the board and I for one, am so fucking here for it. Let’s have another look, shall we? To follow will be a view of who can win each division, who can make playoffs via best record, who can make playoffs as the Highest Points Scorer, and who could be this season’s Johnny.

## We start in the North

### North

| Team      | Record | PF      | PB     |
|-----------|--------|---------|--------|
| Wombats   | 8-4    | 1346.08 | 0.00   |
| Bandits   | 7-5    | 1232.00 | 114.08 |
| Leopards  | 5-7    | 1225.54 | 120.54 |
| Spartans  | 4-8    | 1199.32 | 146.76 |

The North Division has gotten even more straightforward. The Wigan Wombats are now pretty much just needing a single win over the next 2 weeks to secure the division. While not mathematically done with a win, they have a strong advantage in terms of the Points For Tiebreaker over the Bandits which makes it almost impossible for Nottingham to get ahead if records are tied. All eyes will still be on their Week 14 showdown, especially if the Lurgan Leopards can throw another spanner in the works this week by beating the Wombats.

## Onto the Midlands

### Midlands

| Team      | Record | PF      | PB     |
|-----------|--------|---------|--------|
| Otters    | 6-6    | 1208.66 | 0.00   |
| Cobras    | 6-6    | 1190.26 | 18.40  |
| Eagles    | 4-8    | 1060.32 | 148.34 |
| Fireflies | 3-9    | 1107.32 | 101.34 |

The “Someone has to win it” Division of the league is continuing its meander to mediocrity. The only division without a winning record and its leader only just making it into the top half of the league for Points For by 9.34 says everything you need to know about the Midlands. The Derby Otters and Cymru Cobras are currently tied for the division lead with 2 weeks remaining and a showdown this week which could decide it all. At least one of them ‘should’ have a winning record this time next week. Is this division going to boil down to “Who can set a full lineup?”

## And the South

### South

| Team         | Record | PF      | PB     |
|--------------|--------|---------|--------|
| Pythons      | 9-3    | 1530.98 | 0.00   |
| Sandslashers | 8-4    | 1263.50 | 267.48 |
| Seahawks     | 8-4    | 1175.76 | 355.22 |
| Beavers      | 4-8    | 1033.72 | 497.26 |

The situation in the south hasn’t really changed a great deal. The Oxford Pythons require a single win to claim the division, but with the Oxford derby on the cards this week, and both the Andover Sandslashers and Oxford Seahawks breathing down his neck, is a famous Pythons Choke really on the cards here?

## Best Records

As we get into the best record conversation, it feels like our best course of action is to take the overall table and remove our current division leaders from the conversation. This would leave us with the current situation being that the Andover Sandslashers and Oxford Seahawks are our current #4 and #5 Seeds, respectively.

### Overall

| Team         | Record | PF      | PB     |
|--------------|--------|---------|--------|
| Sandslashers | 8-4    | 1263.50 | 0.00   |
| Seahawks     | 8-4    | 1175.76 | 87.74  |
| Bandits      | 7-5    | 1232.00 | 31.50  |
| Cobras       | 6-6    | 1190.26 | 73.24  |
| Leopards     | 5-7    | 1225.54 | 37.96  |
| Spartans     | 4-8    | 1199.32 | 64.18  |
| Beavers      | 4-8    | 1033.72 | 229.78 |
| Eagles       | 4-8    | 1060.32 | 203.18 |
| Fireflies    | 3-9    | 1107.32 | 156.18 |

This order was thrown all over the place with a Bandits loss to the Leopards. We see the Seahawks sneak into the 5th seed; all he needs to do is keep 1 game ahead of the Bandits to stay in his spot. That’s where the conversation ends really. There will be 2 spots filled by either the Sandslashers, Seahawks, or Bandits. It is worth noting that based on record alone, there are still no teams guaranteed a playoff spot. Even the Pythons have the mathematical possibility to drop out of the playoffs. Eliminated Teams are the Leopards, Spartans, Beavers, Eagles, and Fireflies.

## Highest Points Scorer

As you will all know, our 6th and final playoff spot goes to the highest remaining points scorer, so let’s see the overall table, without our current playoff spot holders.

### Race for #6

| Team      | Record | PF      | PB     |
|-----------|--------|---------|--------|
| Bandits   | 7-5    | 1232.00 | 0.00   |
| Leopards  | 5-7    | 1225.54 | 6.46   |
| Otters    | 6-6    | 1208.66 | 23.34  |
| Spartans  | 4-8    | 1199.32 | 32.68  |
| Cobras    | 6-6    | 1190.26 | 41.74  |
| Seahawks  | 8-4    | 1175.76 | 56.24  |
| Fireflies | 3-9    | 1107.32 | 124.68 |
| Eagles    | 4-8    | 1060.32 | 171.68 |
| Beavers   | 4-8    | 1033.72 | 198.28 |

As the table shows, the Bandits currently occupy that spot, but this race is close starting to look like a very Northern Affair. 2 weeks remain, and it’s starting to look like a 4-horse race for the final spot. However, things could be thrown in the air again if any more movements occur within the best record spots. If by the end of the season either the Pythons (1530.98 PF), Wombats (1346.08 PF), or the Sands
