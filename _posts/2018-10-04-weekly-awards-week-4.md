Sorry for the delay in getting these awards to you, work getting in the way of what is truly important! I’ve got to admit they are harder to do when either the Coventry Eagles or the Philadelphia Eagles lose so the intro is short and sweet!

This week results in everyone having a trophy, so we are all winners (Michael and I might need this by the end of the season).

### Worst Line-up Decision  

Dermy refuses to use DeSean Jackson and for a second week I believe that decision has cost him the highest score record (at least the Buzzsaw this week).

I’ll mention Jason’s choice of TE later, but I don’t view it as a mistake as such.

If the Wombats had played Cousins instead of Rivers, then they win the match but the Rams D was 9th in the league compared to the 24th 49ers. But Goff was playing against a Vikings D that had been blown away by the Bills, so that is unforgivable!

### Most Impactful Injury 

Tight end carnage in week 4! 

Gronkowski doesn’t finish the game and it isn’t unreasonable to say that he might have added a TD to his score and that might have edged the match up in the Wombats favour.

OJ Howard didn’t make much difference to the Seahawks' final outcome but he was by far the best TE Dan has on his roster. Will Dissley goes onto IR but the Otters have Rudolph. 

The winner of the award has to be for Tyler Eifert. I missed it live and shouted “his ankle is the wrong way!” when I saw the replay. Nobody is surprised that he is missing time but Tom has decided to back him up with Jordan Reed and Jake Butt!

Special mention to Earl “the Bird” Thomas.

### Closest Matchup 

What a close matchup, it was only 2.7 points that was between the Chargers and the Packers and if the Chargers had played Jesse James instead of Jonnu Smith, then it would have been a 0.1 margin in favour of the Chargers!!! The Packers win and go to 2-2 whilst the Chargers drop to 1-3. Fickle business.

### Unluckiest Loser 
To be fair to Dan, he did try and raise his game against me by posting his highest score of the season so far and it would have been the likes of the 3-1 Otters but you need to get above 130 to challenge me this season!

### The Buzzsaw

Dermy’s 173.1 would have been the highest score of the week, but Travis Kelce woke up in the second half of MNF to allow me to steal this week’s Buzzsaw by just 0.3 points. 

The real difference was down to Joe Mixon being injured, because Gio Bernard was my 3rd highest scorer of the week and that offset Jordan Howard only getting 2.5 points in a Bears rout. If I’d played Sony Michel instead of Howard...

### Highest Individual Player Score

How long is this trend going to continue where the highest individual scorer each week isn’t in a starting line up!?

Mitchell Trubisky scored 43.5 points and he did it completing just 19 passes!!! If he’d scored 1 more TD he would have equalled the record of 2 Superbowl MVPs.

Jared Goff is 2nd but also wasn’t started so that comes down to my Alvin Kamara who I still cannot believe is scoring at this pace. He is the highest scoring payer of the season at the quarter mark and I hope Mark Ingram’s return just means he has more energy rather than fewer opportunities.
