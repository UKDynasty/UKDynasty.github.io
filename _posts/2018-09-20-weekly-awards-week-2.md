Some interesting tidbits from the season so far:

- Two weeks in and we have three teams at 2-0 and three teams at 0-2
- The Bandits have scored more points than the Spartans or the Wombats but have faced 300 points which means instead of being 1-1 like them, they are 0-2
- It has only been intra-divisional games so far and the North has outscored the South 1397 – 1290
- The Fireflies will have the 1st overall pick in 2019 as it stands. The Chargers would beat them on point differential ( -48.9 to -106.4)
- The Sandslashers have a negative points differential but are 1-1

### Worst Line-up Decision  

I am opening this up to everyone, try and find a glaring mistake in anyone’s line ups this week and I will award it next week. There are examples like Jonnu Smith getting 0 points, but the alternatives weren’t there.

Flitwick Fireflies – 🏆  
TBD - 🏆 

### Most Impactful Injury 

Once again, not a bad week for injuries. McCoy and Mixon are out for the Flyers but Barkley, Gordon and Lynch should cover them. The Spartans might be missing Landry and will be relying on DJ Moore to repeat his TD performance and you never know, Lev Bell might turn up!

The Sandslashers losing Jay Ajayi might have the biggest impact in Week 3. Fournette coming back would mean less work for Yeldon so that wouldn’t help. Gore has reached his milestone so the Dolphins might not use him again. Ivory would have been good value with the McCoy injury but is facing the Vikings this week.

### Closest Matchup 

I need to make a correction to last week's closest matchup award. 

It is supposed to be the winner of the match that gets the trophy but I gave it to the loser by mistake. But luckily, the trophy that was taken away from Scott can be given to him this week instead as he was the winner of the closest match in week 2, getting past Dan with 9.8 points to spare. Most of the thanks should go to AJ Green for his Thursday night game.

### Unluckiest Loser 

Brees, Zeke, OBJ, JuJu, Robinson, Cooks and Lockett all on one team last week must have made Josh hopeful that he would finally get a win, and if he had played anyone apart from the Eagles, Otters or Flyers then he would have (it would have been the 3rd highest score in week 1). The defending champs (so hard to type) raised their game and had to post the second-highest score of the week to stay undefeated. Week 3 sees Josh host Olly, and the former is currently a 26 point favourite: maybe he won't be unlucky again.

### The Buzzsaw

I’m going to get sick of writing this as Dermy is once again the top scorer. His 162.6 is more than double the worst score this week but it still isn’t the highest score in the league’s history. That record might be in jeopardy in Week 3, because Brady is at the Lions, Thielen is against Buffalo, Evans is against Pittsburgh and the Giants have nothing apart from Barkley as Eli can’t throw more than 10 yards. 

Irish Flyers – 🏆🏆  

### Highest Individual Player Score

7 of the top 10 scoring players this week were quarterbacks and, for the 2nd week in a row, the actual highest point scorer wasn’t started in the league. Luckily for Chris, Patrick Mahomes was second to Big Ben only by 0.2 points but it didn’t matter as he was playing the Browns, sorry I meant the Fireflies! Mahomes outscored 7 of Michael’s starters which makes me think that maybe the Fireflies should get the 13th pick in the first round of the 2019 draft to compensate for the hand he has been dealt.

Oxford Pythons - 🏆  
Gateshead Spartans - 🏆
