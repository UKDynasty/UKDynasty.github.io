Grudge matches this week. The rematch of last year’s final was a bit of a let down but there was a battle of frenemies between Chris vs Scott and a battle of the Commish vs the controversial add to the group (just messing Dermy!) and those 2 matches were the best this week.

Playoff picture in the North only got fuzzier as the South ended up 4-2 against them and five teams still have a chance at a bye. If Dermy had slipped up against Dan, then the Bandits would have been tied at the top but with 1 game in it and a similar run in, it could get quite interesting.

I’ll just get this out of the way: I locked up the bye in week 9. My path to Christmas disappointment means I don’t care what happens in the next month, I just need all my players to stay - or get - healthy for just 2 weeks (*checks Bengals schedule to make sure Burfict can’t take anyone out…… phew*). Sandslashers and Packers have the edge over the two Oxford teams for the other two playoff places, especially as they have to play against me still!

Three teams thought they were in with a shot for The Buzzsaw but it was destined for one team only: congrats Josh!

### Worst Line-up Decision
  
Several decisions that had little impact on their results:
Cam Meredith went onto the IR on Thursday but that didn’t stop Shep from starting him, and to be fair, it only cost him 6.7 points.

If Josh started Allen Robinson instead of Chris Godwin, his score would have been even higher!

Jason started 4 players who scored zero points! Matthews, Nelson, Chark and Garcon.

Jonathan started the wrong Bills receiver, missing out on 19.3 points.

One that did and could have massive implications:
If Dan played Antony Miller instead of Cooper, MVS, Duke or Ito, he wouldn't have slipped out of the playoff places and the North would be tied at the top.

### Most Impactful Injury 

You asked for it Scott, and you have it. The clearest winner for this one has to be the season ending ACL tear for Cooper Kupp.
 
Kupp was WR18 so far on the season, and with AJ Green’s status up in the air, that leaves Tyler Boyd and Adam Humphries as the highest scoring available receivers for the Sandslasher’s playoff push.

### Closest Matchup 

In a week where one match up was decided by 133 points, the closest match up was decided by just 5.7 points. 

Dermy was behind going into MNF but even though Barkley had a quiet game by his standards, it was enough to pinch the win and keep him on top of the North. For a team that is usually competing for The Buzzsaw, had blowouts at the start of the season and started 6-0, Dermy must be getting concerned that his team is slowing down at the wrong time.

Dan on the other hand must be wondering [*Spoiler alert: he is - **Ed***] why the likes of Ito Smith, Duke Johnson, OJ Howard, MVS and Tevin Coleman put in their lowest scores for the last few weeks just when he needed them the most.

### Unluckiest Loser 

The top 6 scores this week won their matchups for the first time I can remember so by default, Dan and the Seahawks are the unluckiest losers as they had the 7th highest score of the week.

Interestingly, the margin of victory for the Bandits would have been the 3rd highest score of the week!!!

### The Buzzsaw

201 points! That absolutely smashes the league record for highest weekly score and amazingly it could have been 220 points and this award might have to be renamed to the Bandit Buzzsaw going forward. With this score, the Bandits are making a statement to the rest of the North and the league.

### Highest Individual Player Score

The two highest scoring players of the week belonged to two competing teams this week: Mitchell Trubisky outscored Big Ben by 0.2 points to be week 10’s highest point scorer and part of a rare occasion that the HPS is on a winning team. Trubisky is actually the QB7 in our league which I was quite surprised about.
