*** **PRESS RELEASE** *** 

UK Dynasty is proud to announce that the Derby Wolverines franchise has found a new owner. Dermot (Dermy) McAlinden will take over ownership of the struggling Wolverines, and in a shock move, the franchise will be on the move to Northern Ireland. 

The creation of the Irish Flyers marks the first expansion outside of mainland Britain for UK Dynasty. Dermy has a long history of ownership elsewhere, and will be a worthy opponent for the 11 other owners in the league.

There will be no change of league name, because Northern Ireland is part of the UK. Even if expansion outside of the UK ever materialises, UK Dynasty will remain branded as such. As self-important expansionists, the UK Dynasty league prides itself on its similarities to the NFL, and this branding decision is non-reversible, in a commissioner style that also somewhat resembles the National Football League.

The commissioner would like to extend a warm welcome to Dermy and the Irish Flyers.
