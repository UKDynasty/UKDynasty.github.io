### Worst Line-up Decision  

An easier one this week (sorry Chris), as most games were blowouts. During the week, Lamar Miller was listed as doubtful, then out, then active but then the reports were that he wasn’t going to play. Risking him at RB is one thing if you are limited with options but in the flex, there were so many more choices and Blount would have won the week whilst Njoku, Moore and Sutton would have made it closer.

This does come down to the strategy that we decide to play with. Lower floor players with less upside so you at least score something, like Miller most weeks, or the boom and bust player that can win a game all on his own but you risk getting nothing back, a la Brandin Cooks.

### Most Impactful Injury 

The backfield for the Sandslashers is getting gruesome! Fournette now looks like he wont be back until week 10 and one of his replacements, Corey Grant, is now out for the season. Darren Sproles hasn’t played since week 1 and now Jay Ajayi has gone onto IR with a torn ACL. Doubling down on backfields seems to be his thing as he has 2 Dolphins as well.

As an Eagles fan and with you as a Jags fan Scott, can you please drop any of our running backs so they don’t get hurt! You have put a curse of Jamaal Charles! Still, at this rate we will see a lot of throwing at Wembley at the end of the month!

### Closest Matchup 

Not too many close matchups this week as some teams failed to show up. Over 50 point wins in 3 of the games makes the chat about a league reset more plausible (*I think not - **Ed***) but the Spartans and Wombats did put up a fight against each other. The difference in this one was down to the Houston RB situation, with Chris playing Miller and Jonathan playing Blue: the 15 point difference between them is close to the 10 point difference in the overall scores.

### Unluckiest Loser 

Otter Chris scored the 4th highest score of the week but if only he was facing a divisional rival apart from the Flyers... The Pythons, Seahawks and Fireflies all couldn’t break 65 points and when Chris sees that he gets the same result as them, it must make that Championship trophy stick in his craw! That is twice now that the Otters have been unlucky with who they faced and it could be the difference between a bye in the playoffs or not.

### The Buzzsaw

Dermy’s return to the top was helped by 5 players scoring over 20 points in his starting line up (almost 6 as Mixon had 19) to give him a respectable 154.8 points. He was the standout this week as no other team scored above 120. Bye weeks and injuries don’t seem to be slowing him down and puts him as the favourite in the week 6 “UNDEFEATED” bout between him and me.
(Note: I’d done this section before the Eagles/Giants game)

### Highest Individual Player Score

How can you have the top 2 highest scoring players of the week and still lose? Chris and his Otters had James Connor and Todd Gurley starting and they put up 32.5 and 31.3 points respectively and so the first time when someone starts the HIPS of the week, they lose! Bench your stars!
