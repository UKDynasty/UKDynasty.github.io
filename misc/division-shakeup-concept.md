This is a divisional realignment concept put forward by the Wigan Wombats, at the Owners' Meeting 2019, for discussion and voting on by all owners. The concept is as follows:

- Three divisions of four teams (North, Midlands & South)
- Regular season would play divisional opponents twice and seven non-divisional opponents once (i.e. every team in the league except one).
- Playoffs would be three division winners (two winners with best record get a bye) plus three wildcards (maybe as a second suggestion, the third wildcard spot could go to the team with the highest points for total during the season?)

Pros are that it helps to restore some parity now that the league is a few years old - schedules should be fairer in theory, and owners are not as disadvantaged if they are in a tough division.

Cons are you lose the rivalry element somewhat of North vs South, and you no longer have a "conference" champion representing your division in the championship game.

If my geography is right, I think this is how the divisions would look:

**North**:  
Spartans  
Flyers  
Wombats  
Bandits  

**Midlands**:  
Chargers  
Eagles  
Otters  
Fireflies

**South**:  
Seahawks  
Pythons  
Sandslashers  
Packers
