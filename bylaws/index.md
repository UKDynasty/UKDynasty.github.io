## About this document

This is the living, breathing bylaws document of the UK Dynasty league. Revision history from December 2016 onwards can be found [on GitHub](https://github.com/UKDynasty/ukdynasty.github.io/blob/master/bylaws/index.md). The original version of this document (with revision history from the start of the league) can be found [on Google Docs](http://bit.do/UKDynastyLeagueBylaws).

All bylaws are an **explanation** or **extension** of the rules set on ESPN/MyFantasyLeague. This document doesn't outline all aspects of the scoring system, or describe how processes on the host websites work. However, any change in rules within the league hosts will be subject to league disussion/vote, as would any rule within the Bylaws.

## 1. TEAM SETUP

Rosters are a maximum of 20 players, with 9 starters. Starting lineups consist of 1 QB, 2 RBs, 3 WRs, 1 TE, and 2 RB/WR/TE flex spots.

There are 3 spots open for Injured Reserve (IR) on each roster. See the ESPN FAQs for more on this: http://games.espn.go.com/ffl/resources/help/faq?name=how-do-i-move-a-player-on-or-off-the-ir

### 1.1 Increase in roster size from 2017

At the start of the 2017 rookie draft, the roster size will be expanded to 25.

## 2. SCHEDULE

There are two divisions of six teams, North and South, with teams assigned to their division by the geographical position of their town/city. 

Franchises' assigned divisions may change during the off-season at the Commissioner's discretion, to account for geographical balancing if a franchise's ownership changes.

### 2.1 Regular season

The regular season takes place during weeks 1 to 13 of the NFL season. Teams will play all 5 other teams in their division twice, and 3 teams from the other division once. The schedule will be created using MyFantasyLeague.com, and transferred to ESPN manually by the commissioner.

### 2.2 Playoffs

The playoffs run between weeks 14 and 16 of the NFL season.

The winners of each division will receive a bye to the Regional Final. 2nd and 3rd spots will play off in the Regional Semi-Finals for the right to play in the Regional Final. The winners of each of the Regional Finals will face each other in the UK Dynasty Final (the *Britannia Bowl*).

## 3. ROOKIE DRAFT

The 2017 rookie draft will be a 5-round rookie draft (slow email style), held sometime in May (date TBC), using the draft facility on MyFantasyLeague.com. Each team will have 1 draft pick for each round. Picks are tradeable, and immediately processed with commissioner approval during the draft. A 10 hour pick clock will be in use, with the clock paused between the hours of 10pm and 6am.

### 3.1 Reduction to 4 rounds from 2018

From 2018 onwards, the rookie draft will be 4 rounds.

From the off-season before season 3 (start of the 2018 season) and beyond, an off-season roster size of 30 will apply from the close of the rookie draft until 2 weeks before the start of the NFL season, to allow owners to evaluate their players before bringing the roster within the 25-man limit.

Free agents will not be included in the rookie draft.

### 3.1 Order of picks

Rookie draft pick order will be based on the final league and playoff standings, as follows.

Pick 1: Non-playoff team with worst record  
Pick 2: Non-playoff team with 2nd worst record   
Pick 3: Non-playoff team with 3rd worst record  
Pick 4: Non-playoff team with 4th worst record  
Pick 5: Non-playoff team with 5th worst record  
Pick 6: Non-playoff team with 6th worst record  
Pick 7: Regional Semi-Final loser with worst record   
Pick 8: Regional Semi-Final loser with best record   
Pick 9: Regional Final loser with worst record   
Pick 10: Regional Final loser with best record   
Pick 11: UK Dynasty Final losers   
Pick 12: UK Dynasty Final winners 

Due to the divisions each putting 3 teams through to the playoffs, the “7th ranked team” may actually have a better record than the "6th ranked team".

In the event of any tie, the following tie-breakers shall be used, in order (roughly the same as for league standings, but ignoring head-to-head record and divisional record): 

1. Overall points-for 
2. Overall points-against 
3. Coin flip 

## 4. WAIVERS/FREE AGENTS

The league uses the "Free Agent Auction (Continuous)" system of managing free agents during the season. Each team has a budget of $200 which can be used to bid on free agents throughout the season. The $200 will be assigned to each team on league opening each season (around March 1st). Free agents (all non-drafted players and anybody dropped from rosters) are available to bid on at all times. 

During the season (start of week 1 onwards), bids will be processed at 11am ET (4pm UK most of the year-round) on every day of the week except Tuesday.

In the off-season, bids will be processed weekly on Wednesdays at 11am ET (4pm UK most of the year-round). 

For example, if a player is dropped from Team C on Sunday evening in week 3, all owners can enter bids for the player from a minimum of $1. At 11am ET on the next bid processing day (in this case, Monday at 11am ET), the team with the highest bid will have the player added to their roster, and the bid amount deducted from their free agency budget.

## 5. TRADING

Trading is suspended from the Thursday before Week 14 (Week 1 of the UK Dynasty playoffs). Trading re-opens the Monday following the NFL Super Bowl. Trades must be accepted (not just proposed) by the deadline to be valid.

Trades that involve players (and draft picks when available) should be made using the facility on ESPN, or MFL if during the off-season.

You can trade picks for the next year’s rookie draft, and the year after. E.g. During the 2016 season, you can trade 2017 and 2018 rookie draft picks. ESPN doesn't have a facility for trading draft picks during the season, and doesn’t support it at all when using an “offline” draft. There is a messageboard thread (“Report Draft Pick Trade”, linked to from the league homepage) where the draft pick trade should be reported. The commissioner will transfer these to the “Future Rookie Draft Pick Trades” spreadsheet on Google Docs (http://bit.do/UKDynastyLeagueFutureRookieDraftPickTrades), and apply the trades to the rookie draft order prior to the commencement of the relevant year’s draft.  

The dutiful commissioner will have the final decision on whether a trade involving future picks is truly damaging to the future of the league, but this power will only be used in extreme circumstances, when there are clear signs that an owner is underselling picks (or players) with malicious intent. It's unlikely that any trade will ever be rejected for this reason. To be clear, trading of picks because you're in win-now mode doesn't count as malicious.

Each pick trade should be posted to the thread as follows:

Team A give up Year 2017 1st round pick to Team B
Team B give up Year 2017 2nd round pick to Team A

Only one of the teams involved in the trade needs to post details of the trade. The commissioner will email the other party to confirm the trade. Once the other party confirms the trade or 7 days have passed, whichever is sooner, the trade will be deemed complete.

Trades cannot be vetoed unless the trade is an obvious attempt at collusion. Only the commissioner can veto a trade. Trades are not to be vetoed because other owners deem them unfair on one of the parties.

Temporary trades or “loan trades” are prohibited. Examples of a temporary trade include:

- swapping players with another franchise for one week to circumvent a bye week
- trading a player to another franchise for three weeks to help with an injury-hit roster in return for a draft pick

Trades must be made with the intention that they are permanent.

## 6. ANNUAL RULE CHANGES: OWNERS’ MEETING

The league will accept suggestions for rule changes for the upcoming season/s from the culmination of the UK Dynasty Bowl (end of NFL week 16) until the new season start date (generally March 1st), each season.

Any owner can put forward a suggestion of a rule change, and a poll of all owners will be taken on rule changes that cut the commissioner's proverbial mustard (basically anything that's not totally crazy or league-ruining or against the ethos of the league). The majority required for a rule change to pass will be set individually for each proposal. Most of the time, it will be a simple "over 50%" majority required, but for more wide-ranging or serious changes, it may be 75% or more.

Suggested rule changes can include scoring adjustments, waiver wire rules, league calendar adjustments - anything that is set in ESPN rules or the bylaws is up for debate each and every year.

## 7. ETHOS

The aim of UK Dynasty is to be a fun, friendly, active NFL dynasty league that's enjoyable for everyone involved. Try to remain as active as you can, especially during the offseason: one of the best things about dynasty leagues is that they keep you entertained during the long, game-starved summer.

Owners are encouraged to take part in league chat using the league messageboard, and expected to respond to league polls and take part in discussions regarding rule changes and other league matters.

Owners must make an effort to keep their team competitive at all points of the season. “Tanking” - making a purposeful effort to lose a game with the intention of gaining a higher draft pick  - is outlawed. An example of tanking is benching a probable high-scoring player in favour of a probable low-scoring player. With such a close-knit, communicative league, this is unlikely to be an issue, but any owner deemed to be tanking will be warned of the possibility of being replaced, or immediately replaced, depending on the seriousness of the offence. On deciding what is deemed tanking, the commissioner’s decision is final.

The league is free to join and there is no organised prize, but owners must show willing to engage in the league and an interest in leading their team to incredible glory or abject failure over the long-term. Non-active owners will be removed from the league and replaced if attempts to resolve the situation with the owner fail to be successful. This is necessary to keep the league enjoyable for all owners.
